<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE MOATED GRANGE</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Here they are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is, I tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jubilate! You&#8217;re right, old sport! Scooterons-nous
this very sec! Quick! Hurry! Stir your
old bones, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two girls, who had been standing in the
ruined watch-tower that spanned the gateway, tore
down the broken corkscrew staircase at a speed
calculated to imperil their necks seriously, and
reached the bottom at the identical moment that
a motor char-&agrave;-banc rounded the corner and drew
up in front of the entrance. Sixteen jolly faces
were grinning under sixteen school hats, and at
least a dozen excited voices were pouring forth
a perfect babel of exclamations.</p>
<p>&#8220;How ripping!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is top-hole!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a chubby place!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d no idea it would be like this!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hold me up! This child&#8217;s knocked me over
entirely!&#8221;</p>
<p>The opening day of a fresh term is always more
or less of an event, but this particular reunion was
a thrillingly important occasion, for during the
Easter holidays the school had removed, and the
girls were now having their first peep at their new
quarters.</p>
<p>The vision that greeted them through the old
gateway was certainly calculated to justify their
ecstatic remarks. A grassy courtyard, interspersed
with box-edged flower beds and flagged footpaths,
led to a large, gray old Tudor house, whose mullioned
diamond-paned windows, twisted chimney
stacks, irregular moss-grown roof, ivied bell-tower,
stone balls and carved porch offered the very utmost
of the romantic and picturesque. The change from
the humdrum, ordinary surroundings of their former
school was supreme. Miss Beasley had promised
them a pleasant surprise, and she had undoubtedly
kept her word. The sixteen new arrivals grasped
their handbags and small possessions, and set off
up the flagged pathway with delight written large
on their countenances. Raymonde Armitage and
Aveline Kerby, in virtue of half an hour&#8217;s longer
acquaintance with the premises, trotted alongside
and did the honours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s topping! Regular old country mansion
sort of a place. Might have come straight, slap-bang
out of a novel! You should see the Bumble
Bee! I can tell you she&#8217;s pleased with life! Buzzing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
about no end! Even the Wasp&#8217;s got a smile
on! Fact! You needn&#8217;t look so incredulous. I&#8217;m
not ragging.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true,&#8221; confirmed Raymonde. &#8220;The Wasp&#8217;s
quite jinky to-day. Actually said &#8216;my dear&#8217; to me
when I arrived. Of course, Mother was there, but
even then it gave me spasms. Gibbie, of all people
in this wide world, to call me &#8216;my dear&#8217;! I nearly
collapsed! &#8216;Goodness! what next?&#8217; I thought.
&#8216;Wonders will never cease!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gibbie&#8217;s certainly not given to trotting out pet
names, even before parents,&#8221; chirruped Morvyth
Holmes. &#8220;Perhaps she&#8217;s striking out a new line,
and we shall all be &#8216;Darling&#8217; and &#8216;Sweetest&#8217;
now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you alarm yourself! She couldn&#8217;t twist
her tongue round them. I&#8217;d think she was pining
away to an early death if she did! You&#8217;ll hear
plenty of plain, straight, wholesome talking-to
before you&#8217;re half an hour older, my child, or else
I&#8217;m entirely mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> will, old sport, unless you&#8217;ve mended your
ways,&#8221; chuckled Morvyth. &#8220;Are you a reformed
character this term, may I ask? Come back with
a certificate for good behaviour&mdash;no vice, gentle in
harness, a child can drive her, etcetera?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help! The school would die of dullness if I
did! You&#8217;d be positively bored to tears. No, we
all have our talents, and I consider my mission in
life is to keep things humming and cheer you all
up. I may do it at some personal sacrifice,
but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Personal thingumjig!&#8221; interrupted Valentine
Gorton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it is!&#8221; persisted Raymonde, her dark eyes
dancing. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know how disinterested I
am. Gibbie can&#8217;t row us all at once, and when
I draw fire on myself I save you. See? I&#8217;m a
kind of scapegoat for the school. Everybody&#8217;s
sins are stuck on to me. Gibbie lets forth the vials
of her wrath, the storm&#8217;s over, she feels better, and
nobody else is much the worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even you&mdash;you heroic victim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, child, I&#8217;m as used to scolding as
eels to skinning. Neither the Bumble Bee nor
the Wasp worry me. I let them both buzz. It
seems to please them! Indeed, I think they expect
it. When one&#8217;s got a reputation, one&#8217;s bound to
live up to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde Armitage would certainly not have
won a medal for exemplary behaviour, had any
such prize been offered at the school. There was
no harm in her, but her irrepressible spirits were
continually at effervescing point, and in fizzing
over were liable to burst into outbreaks of a nature
highly scandalizing to the authorities. As regarded
Miss Beasley, the Principal, though she upheld
discipline firmly, it was an open secret that she
had a sneaking weakness for Raymonde. &#8220;The
Bumble Bee rows Ray, but she likes her,&#8221; was
the general verdict. With Miss Gibbs, however,
it was a different matter. The humour of a situation
never appealed to her. She frankly considered
her troublesome pupil as a thorn in the flesh, and
perhaps gave her credit for more than she really
deserved in the way of blame. It was whispered
in the school that several enterprising spirits had
managed to shift on to Raymonde&#8217;s shoulders the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
consequences of their own crimes, with results more
satisfactory to themselves than to their lively classmate.
In spite of the fact that she had passed her
fifteenth birthday, Raymonde was the most irresponsible
creature in the world. She looked it.
Her face was as round and smooth as an infant&#8217;s,
with an absurd little dab of a nose, a mouth with
baby dimples at the corners, and small white teeth
that seemed more like first than second ones, and
dark eyes which, when they did not happen to be
twinkling, were capable of putting on a bewitching
innocence of expression calculated to deceive almost
any teacher, however experienced, save the case-hardened
Miss Gibbs.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this term there were twenty-six
girls in the little community assembled at Marlowe
Grange. The old house provided ample
accommodation, and had been easily adapted to
meet the wants of a school. Built originally in
Elizabethan days, it had been added to at various
times, and its medley of architecture, while hopelessly
confusing styles, had resulted in a very
picturesque and charming whole. Perhaps the
most ancient part was the fortified gateway, ruinous
and covered with ivy, but still preserving its
winding stair leading to an upper story that
spanned the entrance. With its tiny loophole
windows and its great solid oak gate with the little
door cut through, it had the aspect of a medi&aelig;val
fortress, and was a fitting introduction to what was
to follow. High walls on both sides enclosed the
courtyard, and farther on, to the right of the house,
was another quaint garden, where shaved yew trees
and clipped hollies presented distorted imitations
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
of peacocks, umbrellas, pagodas, or other ambitious
examples of topiary art. Here, in the late April
weather, spring bulbs were blooming, wallflowers
made a sheet of gold, and the pear trees were opening
pure white blossoms. Little clumps of pansies,
pink daisies, and forget-me-nots were struggling
up, rather mixed amongst the box edging, and
a bank of white alyssum on the rockery near the
hives provided a feast of nectar for the bees, whose
drowsy hum seemed to hold all the promise of the
coming summer.</p>
<p>Behind this garden, and sheltered by the outbuildings
from the north and east winds, lay the
orchard, neglected and unpruned, but very beautiful
with its moss-grown apple trees, its straggling
plums, and budding walnuts, and cherries just bursting
into an ethereal fairy network of delicate palest
pink bloom. Primroses grew here amongst the
grass, and clumps of dog violets and little tufts of
bluebells were pushing their way up to take the
place of the fading daffodils, while a blackthorn
bush was a mass of pure white stars. At the far
end, instead of a hedge, lay the moat, a shallow
stagnant pool, bordered with drooping willows,
tall reeds, and rushes that reared their spear-like
stems from the dark oozy water. Originally this
moat had encircled the mansion as a means of
defence, but now, like the ruined gateway, its
mission was long past, and it survived, a sleepy
witness to the warfare of our forefathers, and a
picturesque adjunct to the general beauty of the
place that could scarcely be surpassed. From the
farther side of the moat peaceful meadows led to
the river, where between high wooded banks a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
stately silver stream glided slowly and tranquilly on
in its path towards the ocean, rippling over weirs,
and bearing on its calm bosom an occasional
pleasure boat, punt, or fussy little motor yacht.</p>
<p>The interior of the old Grange was quaint as its
exterior. The large rooms lent themselves admirably
to school uses. The big hall, with its oak-panelled
walls, stained-glass windows, and huge
fireplace, made an excellent lecture-room, or, when
the forms were moved to one end, provided plenty
of space for drilling or dancing. It seemed strange
certainly to turn an Elizabethan bedroom into a
twentieth-century class-room, and standard desks
looked decidedly at variance with the carved chimney-pieces
or the stags&#8217; antlers that still ornamented
the walls; but the modern element only
seemed to enhance the old, and the girls agreed
that nothing could be more suitable than to learn
history in such a setting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll give us a loophole for lots of our lessons,&#8221;
remarked Raymonde hopefully, as she personally
conducted a party of new arrivals over the establishment.
&#8220;For instance, if I get muddled over circulating
decimals, I&#8217;ll explain that my brains fall
naturally into a medi&aelig;val groove in these surroundings,
and decimals weren&#8217;t invented then,
so that of course it&#8217;s impossible for me to grasp
them; and the same with geography&mdash;the map of
Africa then had about three names on it, so it&#8217;s
quite superfluous to try to remember any more.
I&#8217;m going to cultivate the mental atmosphere of
the place and focus my mind accordingly. I&#8217;ll
concentrate on the Elizabethan period of history,
and the rest I&#8217;ll just ignore.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;ll convince Gibbie!&#8221;
chuckled Muriel Fuller.</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave Gibbie to me! My mind&#8217;s seething
with ideas. It&#8217;s absolutely chock full. I see possibilities
that I never even dreamt of at the old school.
I believe this term&#8217;s going to be the time of my
life. Bless the dear old Bumble Bee! She&#8217;s
buzzed to some purpose in bringing us here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps what struck the girls most of all was
the large dormitory. In the days of the French
Revolution Marlowe Grange had been the refuge
of an order of nuns, who had escaped from Limoges
and founded a temporary convent in the old house.
It was owing to the excellence of their arrangements,
and the structural improvements which they
had left behind them, that the Grange had been so
eminently suitable for a school. Seven little bedrooms
placed side by side served exactly to accommodate
the members of the Sixth Form, while the
great chamber, running from end to end of the
house, with its nineteen snow-white beds, provided
quarters for the rank and file. Just for a moment
the girls had stared rather aghast at their vast
dormitory, contrasting it with the numerous small
rooms of their former school; but the possibilities
of fun presented by this congregation of beds outweighed
the disadvantages, and they had decided
that the arrangement was &#8220;topping.&#8221; It had,
however, one serious drawback. At the far end
was a small extra chamber, intended originally for
the use of the Mother Superior of the convent, and
here, to the girls&#8217; infinite dismay, Miss Gibbs had
taken up her abode. There was no mistake about
it. Her box blocked the doorway; her bag, labelled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
&#8220;M. Gibbs. Passenger to Great Marlowe via
Littleton Junction,&#8221; reposed upon a chair, her
hat and coat lay on the bed, and a neat time-table
of classes was already pinned upon the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t bargain to have the Wasp at such
close quarters!&#8221; whispered Ardiune Coleman-Smith
ruefully. &#8220;She&#8217;ll sleep with both ears
open, and if we stir a finger or breathe a word
she&#8217;ll hear!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheero! There are ways of making people
deaf,&#8221; remarked Raymonde sanguinely. &#8220;How?
Ah, my child, that&#8217;s a surprise for the future!
D&#8217;you suppose&#8221; (with a cryptic shake of the head)
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give away my professional secrets?
I&#8217;ve told you already it&#8217;s my mission to enliven
this school, and if you don&#8217;t have a jinky term I&#8217;ll
consider myself a failure. Haven&#8217;t I started well?
I arrived half an hour before everyone else, and
booked up all the beds on the far side for our
set. Here you are! A label&#8217;s pinned to each
pillow!&#8221;</p>
<p>The six kindred spirits who revolved as satellites
in Raymonde&#8217;s orbit turned to her with a
gush of admiration. It was a brilliant thought to
have labelled the beds, and so secured the most
eligible portion of the dormitory for themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the limit, Ray!&#8221; gurgled Aveline.</p>
<p>Aveline was generally regarded as Raymonde&#8217;s
under-study. She was not so clever, so daring, or
so altogether reckless, but she came in a very good
second-best in most of the harum-scarum escapades.
She could always be relied upon for support, could
keep a secret, and had a peculiarly convenient
knack of baffling awkward questions by putting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
on an attitude of utter stolidity. When her eyes
were half-closed under their heavy lids, and her
mouth wore what the girls called its &#8220;John Bull&#8221;
expression, not even Miss Beasley herself could
drag information out of Aveline. The Sphinx, as
she was sometimes nicknamed, prided herself on
her accomplishment, and took particular care to
maintain her character. Raymonde had apportioned
the bed on her right to Aveline, and that
on her left to Fauvette Robinson, who occupied
about an equal place in her affections.</p>
<p>Fauvette was a little, blue-eyed, fluffy-haired,
clinging, cuddly, ultra-feminine specimen who
hung on to Raymonde like a limpet. Raymonde
twisted her flaxen locks for her in curl rags, helped
to thread baby ribbon through her under-bodices,
hauled her out of bed in the mornings, drummed
her lessons into her, formed her opinions, and
generally dominated her school career. Fauvette
was one of those girls who all their lives lean upon
somebody, and at present she had twined herself,
an ornamental piece of honeysuckle, round the stout
oak prop of Raymonde&#8217;s stronger personality. She
was a dear, amiable, sweet-tempered little soul,
highly romantic and sentimental, with a pretty
soprano voice, and just a sufficient talent for acting
to make her absolutely invaluable in scenes from
Dickens or Jane Austen, where a heroine of the
innocent, pleading, pathetic, babyish, Early Victorian
type was required.</p>
<p>A more spicy character was Morvyth Holmes,
otherwise &#8220;The Kipper.&#8221; Her pale face and shining
hazel eyes showed cleverness. When she
cared to work she could astonish her Form and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
teacher, but her energy came in such odd bursts,
and with such long lapses between, that it did not
in the aggregate amount to much. It was rumoured
in the school that Miss Beasley had her eye on
Morvyth as a possible candidate for public examinations,
and, in fear lest such an honour might be
thrust upon her, Morvyth was careful to avoid the
display of too deep erudition.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do,&#8221; she assured her chums.
&#8220;Catch me swatting for the Senior Oxford like
poor old Meta and Daphne. I tell you those girls
will hardly enjoy a decent game of tennis this
term. The Bumble Bee&#8217;s got their wretched noses
on the grindstone, and they&#8217;ll have a blighting
time till the affair&#8217;s over. No, I&#8217;m a wary bird,
and I&#8217;m not going to be decoyed into an intellectual
trap and dished up for examination. Not even the
Essay Prize shall tempt me! You may win it
yourself, Ray, if you like!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Kipper!&#8221; murmured Raymonde.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a little rough on you that you daren&#8217;t exhibit
your talents. Can&#8217;t you show a doctor&#8217;s certificate
prohibiting you from entering for public exams.&nbsp;and
limiting your prep.? The kind of thing one
brings back to school after scarlet fever, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morvyth shook her head dolefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no go! The Bumble would be capable of
sending for the doctor and thrashing the matter
out with him. My only safety lies in modesty.
No school laurels for me. They cost too dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valentine Gorton and Ardiune Coleman-Smith,
known familiarly as &#8220;Salt&#8221; and &#8220;Pepper,&#8221; were
inseparable friends in spite of the fact that they
quarrelled on an average at least three times a day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Their tiffs were very easily made up, however, and
they always supported each other in upsets with
anyone else, merging what might be termed tribal
disputes in national warfare. Being well supplied
from home with chocolates, and liberal in their
dispensation, they were favourites in their Form,
and indeed throughout the school wore the hallmark
of popularity.</p>
<p>Raymonde&#8217;s particular set of chums was completed
by Katherine Harding, a damsel whose
demure looks belied her character. Katherine&#8217;s
innocent grey eyes and doll-like complexion were
the vineyards that hide the volcano. She could
always be relied upon to support any enterprising
project or interesting hoax that was presented for
her approval. These seven comrades, close chums
in the past, banded themselves together anew to
enjoy life to the best of their ability, and to obtain
the maximum of fun and diversion out of the forthcoming
term. It is with their immediate adventures
that this book is largely concerned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>The Mystic Seven</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you know,&#8221; said Morvyth, flopping down disgustedly
on to a form, and addressing an interested
audience of three; &#8220;d&#8217;you know, my children, that
I consider these two new girls the very limit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolute blighters!&#8221; agreed Raymonde hastily,
&#8220;I was thinking so myself only this morning. I
can&#8217;t decide which is the worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a pin to choose between them!&#8221; commented
Aveline with a yawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave Cynthia Greene credit for shyness during
the first twenty-four hours,&#8221; continued Morvyth.
&#8220;I thought in my own mind, &#8216;the poor thing is
suffering, no doubt, from home-sickness and general
confusion, and we must be gentle with her&#8217;, but
I kept a wary eye upon her, and I&#8217;ve come to a
conclusion. It&#8217;s not shyness&mdash;it&#8217;s swank!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ardiune nodded her head approvingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swank, and nothing else,&#8221; she confirmed. &#8220;I
know something about it too, for I heard her expounding
to her own Form this morning. It
almost made me ill. I had to take a run round
the garden before I felt fit again. It seems she&#8217;s
come from some much smaller school, where she&#8217;s
been the head girl and show pupil, and the rest
of it. She said the younger ones had all looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
up to her, and the Principal had treated her as a
friend, and that she&#8217;d always worked hard to keep
up the tone of the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Sophonisba!&#8221; ejaculated Raymonde. &#8220;Well,
it strikes me we&#8217;ve got the tone of this school to
look after. We can&#8217;t allow Fourth Form kids to
bring those notions and run them here. She won&#8217;t
find herself queen of this establishment!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly!&#8221; chuckled Aveline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t her own Form attending to the matter?&#8221;
enquired Morvyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naturally. They&#8217;re giving her as bad a time
as they know how, but they don&#8217;t make much headway.
She tells them she fully expects to be ragged,
and she simply won&#8217;t believe a word they say.
They haven&#8217;t taken her in once yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because they&#8217;re not skilful,&#8221; said Raymonde
thoughtfully. &#8220;They don&#8217;t do the thing
artistically. There&#8217;s a finesse required for this
kind of work that their stupid young heads don&#8217;t
possess. I&#8217;m not sure if it wouldn&#8217;t be philanthropic
to help them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Set your own house in order first!&#8221; grunted
Ardiune. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have your hands full with
Maudie Heywood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to neglect Maudie; don&#8217;t alarm
yourself! She&#8217;s the best specimen of the genus
prig that I&#8217;ve ever come across in the course of my
life. She ought to have a Form all to herself,
instead of being plumped into the Fifth. I see
dangerous possibilities in Maudie. Do you realize
what she did this morning? Learnt the whole of
that wretched poem instead of only the twenty lines
that were set us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I heard Gibbie complimenting her, and thought
she&#8217;d get swelled head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swelled head indeed! It&#8217;s the principle that&#8217;s
involved. Don&#8217;t you see that if this girl goes and
learns whole poems, Gibbie&#8217;ll think we can do the
same, and she&#8217;ll give us more next time. It&#8217;s
raising the standard of work in the Form.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Minerva! So it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to put a stopper on that,&#8221; urged
Aveline indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a good many things that have given
me spasms since I came back,&#8221; proclaimed Raymonde.
&#8220;They&#8217;re things that ought to be set
right. What I vote is, that our set form ourselves
into a sort of Watch Committee to attend to any
little matters of this sort. It would be a kindness
to the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ardiune chuckled softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means! Let us be the Red Cross
Knights, and go out to right the wrong. We&#8217;ll
attack Duessa straight away, and teach her to mend
her morals. You&#8217;ll let Val be in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather! And Fauvette and Katherine. Seven&#8217;s
a mystic number. You know there were the Seven
Champions of Christendom, and there are the Seven
Ages of Man, and the Seven Days of Creation, and
seven years of apprenticeship, and&mdash;and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven deadly sins!&#8221; suggested Aveline cheerfully.
&#8220;And the Seven Vials&mdash;and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyhow it&#8217;s always seven, so we&#8217;ll make
ourselves into a society. We&#8217;ll have a star with
seven rays for our secret sign. It has a nice
occult kind of smack about it. When we chalk
that mark upon anybody&#8217;s desk, it means we&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
got to reform her, whether she likes it or whether
she doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She probably won&#8217;t,&#8221; twinkled Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the sooner she submits the better. She&#8217;ll
find it&#8217;s no use fighting against fate&mdash;otherwise the
Mystic Seven!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll start business with Cynthia Greene to-morrow,&#8221;
decided Aveline.</p>
<p>Fauvette, Valentine, and Katherine were duly
informed of the existence of the new society and
their initiation thereinto. They offered no objections,
and indeed would have been prepared at
Raymonde&#8217;s request to join a Black Brotherhood,
or a Pirates&#8217; League with a skull and cross-bones
for its emblem. A special committee meeting was
held to discuss the matter of Cynthia Greene.</p>
<p>&#8220;It needs finesse,&#8221; said Morvyth. &#8220;She&#8217;s been
to school before, and she&#8217;s up to most dodges.
Naturally she comprehends that her own Form
are trying to rag her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where we come in,&#8221; agreed Raymonde.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to pose as philanthropists. One
or two of us have got to take Cynthia up. We&#8217;ll
make her realize, of course, how very kind it is of
Fifth Form girls to befriend a lonely junior.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And having taken her up&mdash;what then?&#8221; queried
Fauvette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your innocence, child! Why, we&#8217;ll let
her down with a run!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we all in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it would be too marked. Best leave the
affair to Aveline and me. You others must stand
aloof and look disinterested but sympathetic. I&#8217;ll
speak to her at lunch-time.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>During the mid-morning interval, therefore, Raymonde
singled out her victim. Cynthia was standing
slightly apart from her Form, consuming thick
bread and butter with an air of pensive melancholy,
and twisting a pet bracelet that adorned her
wrist. Raymonde strolled up casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting on all right?&#8221; she began, by way of
opening the attack. &#8220;I say, you know, I thought
I&#8217;d just speak to you. I expect you&#8217;re having a
grizzly time with those wretched juniors. They&#8217;re
a set of blighters, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do find them a little trying,&#8221; admitted Cynthia
cautiously, &#8220;especially as I was head girl at my
old school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather a climb-down from Senior to Junior,
isn&#8217;t it? Why didn&#8217;t Miss Beasley put you in the
Fifth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother asked her to, but she said as I was
only thirteen it was quite impossible. It&#8217;s all right.
I expect to be ragged a little at first. I&#8217;ll live it
down in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cynthia&#8217;s expression of patient resignation was
almost too much for Raymonde, but she controlled
her countenance and continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll respect you all the more afterwards, no
doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so. We didn&#8217;t rag new girls at The
Poplars. I always made a point of showing them
they were welcome. It seemed only fair to Miss
Gordon. She was more like a personal friend than
a teacher, and she looked to me, you see, to keep
up the tone of the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be lost without you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;ll miss me,&#8221; admitted Cynthia,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
with a little fluttering sigh of regret. &#8220;The girls
all subscribed before I left and gave me this bracelet
as a keepsake. It&#8217;s got an inscription inside.
Would you like to look at it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cynthia had unclasped her treasure, and handed
it with an assumed nonchalance for Raymonde&#8217;s
inspection. On the gold band was engraved: &#8220;To
Cynthia Greene, a token of esteem from her schoolfellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Highly gratifying!&#8221; gurgled Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was sweet of them, wasn&#8217;t it? Well, I tried
to do my best for them, and I&#8217;ll do my best for this
school too when I get the chance. I&#8217;m in no hurry.
I&#8217;m content to wait, and let the girls come round.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite the best plan. In the meantime, if there
are any little tips I can give you, come to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks awfully! I will. I&#8217;d have done the
same by you if you&#8217;d been a new girl at The
Poplars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde retired bubbling over with suppressed
mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl&#8217;s the limit!&#8221; she reported to her confederates.
&#8220;For calm self-complacency I&#8217;ve never
seen anybody to equal her. The idea of imagining
<i>me</i> as a new girl at her wretched pettifogging old
school! Oh, it&#8217;s too precious! She&#8217;d patronize the
Queen herself! The Poplars must be executing a
war-dance for joy to have got rid of her. Probably
they&#8217;d have subscribed for more than a bracelet to
pass her on elsewhere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So she&#8217;s waiting patiently till she wins the
school,&#8221; hinnied Aveline. &#8220;Poor angel! Did
you notice her wings sprouting, or a halo glowing
round her head?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I think we can put her up to a few tips,&#8221;
chuckled Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would only be kind,&#8221; gushed Raymonde.
&#8220;The sort of thing she must have done herself
hundreds of times to many a poor neglected new
girl at The Poplars. The bread she cast upon the
waters shall be returned to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With butter on it!&#8221; added Aveline.</p>
<p>&#8220;She can swallow any amount of butter,&#8221; observed
Raymonde. &#8220;She evidently likes it laid on
thick. Suggestions invited, please, for kind and
disinterested advice to be administered to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Marshall comes to-morrow,&#8221; volunteered
Aveline.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very thing! Ave, you old sport, you&#8217;ve
given me an idea! Now just prepare your minds
for a pretty and touching little scene at the beginning
of the medi&aelig;val arts lecture. No, I shan&#8217;t
tell you what it is beforehand. It&#8217;ll be something
for you to look forward to!&#8221;</p>
<p>The staff at Marlowe Grange consisted of Miss
Beasley, Miss Gibbs, and Mademoiselle, but there
were several visiting masters and mistresses who
had attended at the former house, and were now to
continue their instructions at the school in its present
quarters. Among these Professor Marshall
was rather a favourite. As befitted a teacher in an
establishment of young ladies, he was grey-haired
and elderly, and, as the girls added, &#8220;married and
guaranteed not to flirt,&#8221; but all the same he was
jolly, had a hearty, affable manner, and a habit of
making bad jokes and weak puns to break up the
monotony of his lectures. It was decidedly the
fashion to admire him, to snigger indulgently at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
his mild little pleasantries, and to call him &#8220;an old
dear.&#8221; Some of the girls even worked quite hard
at their preparation for him. He had written his
autograph in at least nineteen birthday books, and
it was rumoured that, when the auspicious 10th of
March had come round, no less than fourteen anonymous
congratulatory picture post-cards had been
directed to him from the school and posted by
stealth. Having already improved their minds
upon a course of English Classics and Astronomy,
the school this term was booked for culture, and
devoted to the study of the fine arts of the Middle
Ages. A few selected members of the Sixth had
been told off to search through back numbers of <i>The
Studio</i> and <i>The Connoisseur</i> for examples of the
paintings of Cimabue and Giotto, and the large
engraving of Botticelli&#8217;s &#8220;Spring,&#8221; which used to
hang in Miss Beasley&#8217;s study, now occupied a
prominent position on the dining-room wall to
afford a mental feast during meal-times.</p>
<p>Raymonde, anxious not to overdo things, left
Cynthia to herself for the rest of the day; but the
following morning, after breakfast, she seized an
opportunity for a few words with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t mind my giving you a hint or two
on school etiquette?&#8221; she observed casually. &#8220;You
see, there are traditions in every school that one
likes to keep up, and of course you can&#8217;t find them
out unless you&#8217;re told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be very glad,&#8221; gushed Cynthia gratefully.
&#8220;We&#8217;d a regular code at The Poplars, and I used
to initiate everybody. They always came straight
to me, and I coached them up. I can&#8217;t tell you
how many new girls I&#8217;ve helped in my time!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re new yourself now,&#8221; said Raymonde,
detaching Cynthia&#8217;s mind from these reminiscences
of past service and bringing it up to
date. &#8220;Professor Marshall&#8217;s coming to-day, and
you&#8217;ll have to be introduced to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear! I&#8217;m so shy! I wonder what he&#8217;ll
think of me?&#8221; fluttered Cynthia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think you&#8217;re the sickliest idiot he ever met!&#8221;
was on the tip of Raymonde&#8217;s tongue, but she
restrained herself, and, drawing her victim aside,
whispered honeyed words calculated to soothe and
cheer, adding some special items of good advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; sighed Cynthia. &#8220;I won&#8217;t forget.
Of course, we never did such a thing at The Poplars,
but, if it&#8217;s expected, I won&#8217;t break the traditions
of the school. You can always depend upon me in
that respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Precisely at 11.30 the whole of the school was
assembled in the big hall awaiting the presence of
their lecturer. Professor Marshall, who had been
regaling himself with lunch in Miss Beasley&#8217;s study,
now made his appearance, escorted by the head mistress,
and apparently refreshed by cocoa and conversation.
The girls always agreed that his manners
were beautiful. He treated everybody with a courtly
deference, something between the professional consideration
of a fashionable doctor and the dignity of
an archdeacon. After Miss Gibbs&#8217;s uncompromising
attitude, the contrast was marked. He entered
the room smiling, bowed a courteous good morning
to his pupils, who rose to receive him, and placed a
chair for Miss Beasley with gentlemanly attention.</p>
<p>The Principal, radiant after showing off her new
quarters, refused it with equal politeness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Professor. I&#8217;m not going to
stay. I have other work to do. You will find your
class the same as before, with the addition of two
new girls. Maude Heywood&mdash;come here, Maudie!&mdash;and
Cynthia Greene. I hope they&#8217;ll both prove
good workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maudie Heywood, blushing like a lobster,
stepped forward and thrust three limp fingers for
a fraction of a second into the Professor&#8217;s large
clasp, then thankfully merged her identity among
her schoolfellows. Cynthia, who was behind her,
smiled bewitchingly upwards into the florid, benevolent
face of her new instructor, then, falling
gracefully upon one knee, seized his hand and
touched it with her lips.</p>
<p>The sensation in the room was immense. The
Professor, looking decidedly astonished and embarrassed,
hastily withdrew his hand from the affectionate
salutation. Miss Beasley&#8217;s eyes were round
with horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cynthia!&#8221; she exclaimed, and the tone of her
voice alone was sufficient reproof.</p>
<p>The luckless Cynthia, instantly conscious that
her act had been misconstrued, retired with less
grace than she had come forward, and spent most
of the lecture in surreptitiously mopping her eyes.
As she walked dejectedly down the corridor afterwards,
she was accosted by Hermione Graveson, a
member of the Sixth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; said Hermione briefly. &#8220;What
prompted you to make such an utter exhibition of
yourself just now? I never saw anything more
sickening in my life!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cynthia&#8217;s tears burst forth afresh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my fault,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
want to do it, but I was told it was school etiquette
and I must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told you such rubbish?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl with the dark eyes and a patriotic hair
ribbon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymonde Armitage?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that&#8217;s her name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hermie shook her head solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;New girls are notoriously callow,&#8221; she remarked,
&#8220;but I should have thought anybody with
the slightest grain of sense could have seen at a
glance what Raymonde is. Why, she&#8217;s simply
been playing ragtime on you. Did you actually and
seriously believe that the girls at this school were
expected to go through such idiotic performances?
Don&#8217;t believe a word Raymonde tells you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom shall I believe? Everybody tries to
stuff me!&#8221; wailed the injured Cynthia. &#8220;I never
treated anybody like this at The Poplars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust your common sense&mdash;that is, if you
happen to have any; and, for goodness&#8217; sake, don&#8217;t
snivel any more. Wipe your eyes and take it
sporting. And, wait a moment. If you want a
bit of really good, sound advice, don&#8217;t mention The
Poplars again, or the fact that you were head girl
there, and the idol of the school, and the rest of it.
You&#8217;re only a junior here, and the sooner you find
your level the better. We&#8217;re not exactly aching to
have our tone improved by you! And, look here!
Take that absurd keepsake bracelet off, and lock it
up in your box, and don&#8217;t let anybody see it again
till the end of the term. There! go and digest
what I&#8217;ve told you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>Having settled with Cynthia Greene, it now remained
for the Mystic Seven to turn their attention
to the matter of Maudie Heywood. The situation
was growing acute. Maudie had been ten days at
the Grange, and in that brief space of time she was
already beginning to establish a precedent. She
was a tall, slim girl, with earnest eyes, a decided
chin, and an intellectual forehead. Work, with a
capital W, was her fetish. She sat during classes
with her gaze focused on her teacher, and a look of
intelligent interest that surpassed everyone else in
the Form. Miss Gibbs turned instinctively to
Maudie at the most important points of the lesson.
There was a feeling abroad that she sucked in knowledge
like a sponge. Nobody would have objected
to her consuming as much as she liked of the
mental provender supplied had she stopped at that.
Maudie unfortunately was over-zealous, and finding
the amount of preparation set her to be well
below the limit of her capacity, invariably did a
little more than was required. Her maps were
coloured, her botany papers illustrated with neat
drawings, her history exercises had genealogical
tables appended, and her literature essays were full
of quotations. This was all very exemplary, and
won golden opinions from Miss Gibbs, but it caused
heartburnings in the Form. It was felt that
Maudie was unduly raising the standard. Miss
Gibbs had suggested that other botany papers
might contain diagrams, and had placed upon the
class-room chimney-piece a book of poetical
extracts suitable for use in essay-writing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t take care we&#8217;ll be having our prep.
doubled,&#8221; said Aveline uneasily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>It was decided to reason with Maudie before
taking any more active measures. The united
Seven tackled her upon the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised Mother I&#8217;d work,&#8221; urged Maudie,
in reply to their remonstrances.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve no need to work overtime,&#8221; objected
Ardiune. &#8220;We don&#8217;t mind how hard you
swat during prep., but it isn&#8217;t right for you to be
putting in extra half-hours while the rest of us are
in the garden. It&#8217;s stealing an advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a work of supererogation,&#8221; added Katherine.</p>
<p>Maudie wrinkled up her intellectual forehead
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Works of supererogation are supposed to
count,&#8221; she interposed in her precise, measured
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if they&#8217;re done with intention for somebody
else!&#8221; flared Raymonde. &#8220;But yours aren&#8217;t!
They&#8217;re entirely for your own pride and vanity.
Do you come and translate my Latin for me in
those extra half-hours? Not a bit of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that wouldn&#8217;t be fair!&#8221; Maudie&#8217;s tone
was of shocked virtue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more unfair to heap burdens on the rest
of your Form.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m bound to do my best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; burst out Aveline, &#8220;you&#8217;re suffering
from an over-developed conscience. You&#8217;ve
got an abnormal appetite for work, and it ought
to be checked. It isn&#8217;t good for you. Promise
us you won&#8217;t write or learn a word out of prep.
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maudie shook her head sadly. Her grey eyes
gleamed with the enthusiasm of the martyr spirit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t promise anything,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;Something
within me urges me to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then something without you will have to put
a stop to it,&#8221; snapped Raymonde. &#8220;We&#8217;ve given
you full and fair warning; so now you may look
out for squalls.&#8221;</p>
<p>When preparation was over, the girls were allowed
to amuse themselves as they liked until supper.
Most of them adjourned to the garden, for the
evenings were getting longer and lighter every
day, and the tennis courts were in quite fair condition.
It was Maudie&#8217;s habit to take a pensive
stroll among the box-edged flower beds in the
courtyard, and then repair to the class-room again
to touch up her exercises. On this particular evening
Raymonde, with a contingent of the Mystic
Seven, lingered behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just about ten minutes,&#8221; she announced.
&#8220;Old Maudie&#8217;s as punctual as a clock. She&#8217;ll
walk five times round the sundial and twice to the
gate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That girl&#8217;s destined for the cloister,&#8221; said Aveline
pityingly. &#8220;She&#8217;s evidently thirsting to live
her life by rule. Mark my words, she&#8217;ll eventually
take the veil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, she&#8217;ll pass triumphantly through College
and come out equal to a double-first or Senior
Wrangler, or something swanky of that kind, and
get made head mistress of a high school,&#8221; prognosticated
Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime, she won&#8217;t swat any more to-night!&#8221;
grinned Raymonde. &#8220;Wait for me here,
girls; I&#8217;ve got to fetch something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde performed her errand with lightning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
speed. She returned with a lump of soft substance
in one hand, and a spirit-lamp and curling-tongs
in the other. Her chums looked mystified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cobblers&#8217; wax!&#8221; she explained airily. &#8220;Brought
some with me, in case of emergency. It&#8217;s useful
stuff. And I just looted Linda Mottram&#8217;s curling
apparatus from her bedroom. Don&#8217;t you twig?
What blind bats you are! I&#8217;m going to stick up
Maudie&#8217;s desk!&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde lighted the spirit-lamp and heated
the tongs, then spreading a thick coating of the
wax along the inside edge of the desk, she applied
the hot iron to melt it, and put down the lid.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will have hardened by the time Maudie has
finished her constitutional among the flower beds,&#8221;
she giggled. &#8220;I&#8217;ll guarantee when she comes
back she won&#8217;t be able to open her desk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only right for her to feel the pressure of
public opinion,&#8221; decreed Ardiune. &#8220;We&#8217;re working
in a good cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re modest about it, and don&#8217;t want to
push ourselves forward,&#8221; urged Raymonde. &#8220;I
vote we go for a stroll down to the very bottom of
the orchard, near the moat.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later, Miss Beasley and Miss
Gibbs were sitting together in the Principal&#8217;s study
enjoying a well-earned period of repose and a chat.
Their conversation turned upon the varied dispositions
of their pupils.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maudie Heywood strikes me as a very earnest
character,&#8221; observed Miss Beasley, toying with the
violets in her belt. &#8220;Her work is really excellent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost too good,&#8221; agreed Miss Gibbs, who
was perhaps beginning to find out that Maudie&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
exercises took twice as long to correct as anybody
else&#8217;s, and thus sensibly curtailed her teacher&#8217;s
leisure. &#8220;The child is so conscientious. In my
opinion she needs to concentrate more on physical
exercise. I should like to see her in the tennis
courts instead of copying out reams of poetry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Miss Beasley, looking thoughtful.
&#8220;Her activities perhaps need a little adjustment.
We mustn&#8217;t allow her to neglect her health. She
looks over-anxious sometimes for a girl of fifteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is always such a calm, self-controlled,
well-regulated child,&#8221; remarked Miss Gibbs appreciatively.</p>
<p>At that moment there was a hurried rap-tap-tap;
the door opened, and Maudie burst in unannounced.
Her calm self-control had yielded to
an agitated condition of excitement and indignation.
Her earnest eyes were flashing angry sparks, and
her cheeks were crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miss Beasley!&#8221; she began, &#8220;those girls
have actually gone and stuck up my desk, so that
I can&#8217;t get out my books. They say I work overtime,
and it&#8217;s not fair, for if I like to work, why
shouldn&#8217;t I? I just detest the whole lot of them!
I hate this place!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re forgetting yourself, Maudie,&#8221;
returned the Principal. &#8220;It is hardly good manners
to enter my study so abruptly and to speak in this
way to me. If you wish to please me, I should
much prefer you to spend your leisure time at games
instead of lessons. To-morrow evening I hope to
see you playing tennis. If you ask the cook for
a screw-driver you&#8217;ll probably be able to wedge
open your desk easily. But in future you&#8217;ll be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
wiser to confine your work to the preparation hours.
The bow must be unstrung sometimes, or your
health will suffer. If you join with the other girls
at their games you&#8217;ll soon get to know them, and
feel more at home here. Try to be sociable and
make yourself liked. Part of the training of school
life is to learn to accommodate yourself to a community.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crestfallen Maudie retired, murmuring
apologies. Miss Beasley picked up her copy of
<i>The Graphic</i> and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule, we may trust the girls themselves to
do any necessary pruning. They&#8217;re the strictest
Socialists that could be imagined. They instinctively
have all the principles of a trade union
about them. On the whole, it&#8217;s good for Maudie
to be restrained. A little innocent practical joke
will do her no harm for once. She must be able
to take her share of teasing. Humour is her one
deficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can guess who&#8217;s at the bottom of the
business,&#8221; sniffed Miss Gibbs. &#8220;Raymonde Armitage
is the naughtiest girl in the school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me!&#8221; corrected Miss Beasley. &#8220;The
most mischievous, perhaps, and the most troublesome;
full of bubbling spirits and misplaced energy,
but straightforward and truthful. There is something
very lovable about Raymonde.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>The Limberlost</h3>
</div>
<p>Everybody agreed that Marlowe Grange was an
ideal spot for a school. The picturesque old orchard
and grounds provided an almost unlimited
field of amusement. Those girls who were interested
in horticulture might have their own little
plots at the end of the potato patch, and a delightful
series of experiments had been started down
by the moat, where a real, genuine water-garden
was in process of construction. Here, duly shod
in rubber waders, a few enthusiasts toiled almost
daily, planting iris and arrow-head and flowering
rush, and sinking water-lily roots in old wicker
baskets weighted with stones. There was even
a scheme on hand to subscribe to buy a punt, but
Miss Beasley had frowned upon the idea as containing
too great an element of danger, and of
consequent anxiety for teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want a set of Ophelias drowning themselves
among the willows and the long purples!&#8221;
she remarked firmly. &#8220;If we bought a punt, we
should need a drag and a life-belt as well. You
shall go for a row on the river sometimes during
the summer, and that must content you. There
are plenty of occupations on dry land to amuse
yourselves with.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>The Grange certainly contained ample space for
interests of every description. The old farm buildings
made sheds for carpentry and wood-carving,
or any other work that was too messy for the schoolrooms.
Under the direction of Miss Gibbs, some
of the elder girls were turning the contents of a
wood pile into a set of rustic garden seats, and
other industrious spirits had begun to plait osierwithes
into baskets that were destined for blackberry
picking in the autumn. The house itself was roomy
enough to allow hobbies to overflow. Miss Beasley,
who dabbled rather successfully in photography,
had a conveniently equipped dark-room, which she
lent by special favour to seniors only, on the understanding
that they left it as they found it. Miss
Gibbs had taken possession of an empty attic, and
had made it into a scientific sanctum. So far none
of the girls had been allowed to peep inside, and
the wildest rumours were afloat as to what the room
contained. Batteries and other apparatus had been
seen to be carried upstairs, and those scouts who
had ventured along the forbidden upper landing
reported that through the closed door they could
hear weird noises as of turning wheels or bubbling
crucibles. It was surmised in the school that Miss
Gibbs, having found a congenial medi&aelig;val atmosphere
for her researches, was working on the lines
of the ancient alchemists, and attempting to discover
the elixir of life or the philosopher&#8217;s stone.
One fact was certain. Miss Gibbs had set up a
telescope in her solitary attic. She had bought it
second-hand, during the holidays, from the widow
of a coastguardsman, and with its aid she studied
the landscape by day and the stars by night. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
girls considered she kept a wary eye on watch for
escaped Germans or Zeppelins, and regarded the
instrument in the light of a safeguard for the
establishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides which, anything&#8217;s a blessing that takes
Gibbie upstairs and keeps her from buzzing round
us all the time,&#8221; averred Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s welcome to keep anything she likes in
her room, from a stuffed crocodile to a snake in
a bottle!&#8221; yawned Fauvette. &#8220;All I ask is that
she doesn&#8217;t take me up and improve my mind.
I&#8217;m getting fed up with hobbies. I can&#8217;t show an
intelligent interest in all. My poor little brains
won&#8217;t hold them. What with repouss&eacute; work and
stencilling and chip carving, I hardly ever get half
an hour to enjoy a book. My idea of a jinky time
is to sit by the moat and read, and eat chocolates.
By the by, has that copy of <i>The Harvester</i> come
yet? Hermie promised to get it for the library.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls at the Grange had fashions in books,
and at present they were all raving over the works
of Gene Stratton Porter. Even Raymonde, not
generally much of a reader, had succumbed to
the charms of <i>Freckles</i> and <i>A Girl of the Limberlost</i>.
The accounts of the American swamp forest
fascinated her. It was a veritable &#8220;call of the
wild.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give anything&mdash;just anything&mdash;to get into
such a place!&#8221; she confided to Fauvette. &#8220;I&#8217;d
chance even the snakes and mosquitoes. Just think
of the trees and the flowers and the birds and the
butterflies! Why don&#8217;t we have things like that
in England?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect we do, only one never gets to see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
them. There&#8217;s a wood over there on the hill that
looks absolutely top-hole if one could go into it.
Hermie said the other day that the Bumble Bee
had buzzed out something about taking us all for
a picnic there some day. It would be rather
precious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde shook her head reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Picnics are all very well in their way, but when
you turn about thirty people together into a wood,
I fancy the birds and butterflies will give us a wide
berth. Freckles found his specimens when he was
alone. You can&#8217;t go naturalizing in a crowd!
Look here! Suppose you and I go and explore.
I&#8217;ll be the Bird Woman, and you can be the
Swamp Angel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a blossomy idea! But what about
Gibbie? Can we dodge her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait till she&#8217;s shut herself up in her attic,
and then we&#8217;ll scoot. Between tea and prep.&#8217;s the
best time, especially now prep.&#8217;s been put later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really have the most chubby inspirations,
Ray,&#8221; burbled Fauvette. &#8220;You&#8217;re an absolute
mascot!&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea of posing as the Swamp Angel appealed
to Fauvette. She was conscious that she looked
the part. She fingered her fluffy flaxen curls
caressingly, and resolved to wear a blue cotton
dress for the next day or two, in case there was
a chance of the expedition. In imagination she
was already photographing rare birds and shooting
villains with revolvers, and looking her best through
it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew how to mix iced drinks,&#8221; she
sighed regretfully. &#8220;One can&#8217;t get even the ice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
over here, not to speak of the bits of cherry and
lemon and grape and pineapple that the Angel
used for Freckles. Girls in America have a far
better time than we have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheero! We&#8217;ll get a little fun, you&#8217;ll see, if
we can only circumvent the Wasp.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not a remarkably easy matter to leave the
premises unobserved. Monitresses had a tiresome
habit of hanging about in places where they were
not wanted; Mademoiselle made herself far too conspicuous,
and Miss Gibbs seemed everywhere. The
chums decided that a too great attention to duty
can degenerate into a fault.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what Miss Beasley said in the Scripture
lesson,&#8221; declared Raymonde. &#8220;Economy over-done
turns into parsimony, liberality into extravagance,
self-respect into pride. Gibbie&#8217;s over-stepping
the mark, and letting responsibility run
to fussiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is hardly possible to tackle a mistress and convince
her of her faults, so Miss Gibbs&#8217;s pharisaical
tendencies went unchecked. Evidently the only
possible method was to dodge her. Whether her
suspicions were aroused it is impossible to say,
but for several days she neglected her attic sanctum
and pervaded the garden during recreation hours.</p>
<p>Raymonde and Fauvette lay low, and toiled with
an amazing spurt of industry at osier-weaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve each nearly finished a basket,&#8221; said
Miss Gibbs approvingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if we go on working hard this afternoon
I think we shall finish them,&#8221; replied Raymonde
craftily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to have a thing done. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
taken to such a sensible employment,&#8221; commented
Miss Gibbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to have our fingers occupied, and then
our minds haven&#8217;t time to wander,&#8221; said Raymonde,
quoting so shamelessly from Miss Beasley that
Fauvette kicked her surreptitiously in alarm.</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs regarded her for a moment with
suspicion, but her eyes were bent demurely over
her basket, and her expression was innocence
personified.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as well you have something to do under
cover, for I think it&#8217;s going to rain,&#8221; observed the
mistress as she turned to leave the barn.</p>
<p>The girls watched her cross the courtyard and
enter the house; then Fauvette, scooting in by the
back way, had the further satisfaction of seeing
the tail of her skirt whisking up the attic stairs.
She ran back to report to Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gibbie&#8217;s safe in her sanctum. She thinks we&#8217;re
happily employed here for the next hour. Let&#8217;s
bolt for the Limberlost! There&#8217;s nobody in the
courtyard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221; echoed Raymonde. &#8220;It&#8217;s the opportunity
of a lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not wait to fetch hats, but, strolling
down the flagged path as if for exercise, reached
the great gate. Then, glancing cautiously round
to see that the coast was absolutely clear, they unlatched
the little postern door, slipped through,
and shut it after them. A moment later they were
running at top speed down the road that led to the
wood. It was not a very great distance away, and
they had often passed near it in their walks. To
scramble over the palings and enter its cool, mysterious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
shade had been their dream. They were
resolved now to make it a reality.</p>
<p>They had been prepared for something delightful,
but not for the little terrestrial paradise that
spread itself at the farther side of the fence. The
wood had been thinned comparatively recently, so
that it admitted an unusual amount of light and
air. The trees, just bursting into the tender green
of early May, spread delicate lacy boughs overhead,
like tender fingers held out to guard the
treasures underneath. The ground below, still
moist and boggy from the spring rains, was clothed
with a carpet of dog violets, growing in such profusion
that they seemed to stretch in a vista of
palest mauve into the distance. At close intervals
among these grew glorious clumps of golden cowslips
and purple meadow orchis, taller and finer
by far than those in the meadows, and deliciously
fragrant. In the swampy hollows were yellow
marsh marigolds and blue forget-me-nots; on the
drier soil of the rising bank the wild hyacinths
were just shaking open their bells, and heartsease
here and there lifted coy heads to the sunlight.</p>
<p>Raymonde and Fauvette wandered about in
ecstasy, picking great bunches of the flowers, and
running from clump to clump with thrills of delight.
Surely even Freckles&#8217;s &#8220;Limberlost&#8221; could
not be more beautiful than this. A persistent cuckoo
was calling in the meadow close by; a thrush with
his brown throat all a-ruffle trilled in a birch tree
overhead, and a blackbird warbled his heart out
among the hazel bushes by the fence. The girls
went peeping here and there and everywhere in
quest of birds&#8217; nests, and their diligent search was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
amply rewarded. In the hollow of a decaying
stump a robin was feeding five little gaping mouths,
the blackbird&#8217;s mate guarded four speckled eggs,
and three separate thrushes had pale-blue treasures
in clay-lined cradles amidst the undergrowth.</p>
<p>As they penetrated farther into the wood they
struck upon a pond closely surrounded by sallows
and alders. Raymonde peered through the shimmering
leaves, and called Fauvette with a cry of
joy, for covering almost the entire surface of the
water was a mass of the gorgeous pale-pink fringed
blossoms of the bog bean. The girls had never
found it before, and it was indeed rare for it to be
growing in a Midland county. They thought it
was the most beautiful flower they had ever seen.
How to pick any was the difficulty, for even the
nearest piece lay fully a yard from the edge of the
pond, and the finest blooms were in the middle
of the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get some somehow, if I have to
take off my shoes and stockings!&#8221; declared Raymonde.</p>
<p>An easier way than wading, however, presented
itself. Close by the side of the pond was a young
tree which had been blown over by the spring
gales; the forester had chopped it from its roots,
but had not yet removed it. By dint of much
energy the girls lifted this, and pushed it over the
water till part of it rested securely on an alder
which grew on a little island in the midst. It made
a rather shaky but perfectly possible bridge, if not
for Fauvette, at least for Raymonde. The latter
advanced upon it cautiously but courageously. She
took three steps, almost slipped, but regained her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
balance by a miracle, grasped an overhanging
bough of the alder, and set a firm foot on the
island. From here, by reaching a long arm, she
could gather some fine specimens of the bog bean.
She pulled it up in handfuls, with trailing oozy
stalks. As she turned to grip the alder branch
before venturing back over her primitive bridge,
her eye suddenly caught sight of a large nest built
at the extreme brink of the water. It held four
browny-speckled eggs, and an agitated moorhen,
seeking cover among the reeds, gave the clue to
their parentage.</p>
<p>The school was making a collection of birds&#8217;
eggs for its museum. There were plenty of robins&#8217;
and thrushes&#8217; and blackbirds&#8217;, and all the common
varieties, but so far not a solitary specimen of a
moorhen&#8217;s egg. Raymonde felt that even at the
risk of betraying their secret expedition she must
secure some of these. She decided to go halves,
to take two and leave two in the nest to console
the moorhen when she came back. She wrapped
them in some grass and packed them in her handkerchief,
which she slung round her neck for safety.
Then taking her bunch of bog bean she managed
to scramble back to the bank.</p>
<p>The girls were naturalists enough to remove
their tree-trunk from the island, lest it should
tempt marauding boys to go across and discover
the moorhen&#8217;s nest. They hoped the bird would
return and sit again when they were out of the
way. Each carefully carrying one of the precious
eggs, they went on farther to explore the wood.
They had only walked a short distance when
Fauvette stopped suddenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that queer squeaking noise?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear it too?&#8221; confirmed Raymonde.</p>
<p>The girls glanced round, and then looked at each
other blankly. There was no doubt that the persistent
chirruping and peeping came from the eggs
in their hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, good night! The wretched things are
hatching out!&#8221; gasped Raymonde.</p>
<p>They had indeed robbed the poor moorhen at the
very moment when her chicks were in the process
of hatching. Already there was a chip in the side
of each egg, and a tiny bill began to protrude, the
owner of which was raising a shrill clamour of welcome
to the world. The girls laid them hastily
down on the grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those won&#8217;t be any use for the museum!&#8221;
exploded Fauvette.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if we ought to put them back,&#8221; murmured
Raymonde, decidedly conscience-stricken,
though somewhat unwilling to venture again over
the slippery tree-trunk.</p>
<p>She might perhaps have braved the crossing, and
restored the eggs to the nest, but at that moment
the rain, which had been threatening all the afternoon,
came down in a torrent. She felt it had
sealed the fate of the chicks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to leave them here. It&#8217;s like
murder, but I can&#8217;t help it. If we don&#8217;t get back
quick we shall be drenched.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the girls turned to retrace their steps they
became aware that they were not alone in the
wood. Some distance among the bushes a dark
coat and hat were plainly advancing in their direction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Undoubtedly somebody had been watching
them and was following them. Wild visions of
Black Jack and his &#8220;Limberlost&#8221; gang swam before
their eyes, and with one accord they ran&mdash;ran
anywhere, panic-stricken, bent only on escaping.</p>
<p>A voice shouted, and it added to their terror, and
sent them hurrying on the faster. They imagined
oaths and pistol-shots behind them. Such exciting
scenes were all very well in the pages of <i>Freckles</i>,
but they would be decidedly out of place in an
English wood. When it came to the point, neither
of them possessed the courage and presence of
mind of the Swamp Angel.</p>
<p>Suppose they found themselves bound and
gagged, and tied to trees, while some dastardly
ruffians hewed down the best timber in the wood?
The shouts behind grew nearer. Their pursuer
was evidently gaining upon them. Through the
pouring rain they struggled on, splashing anyhow
through swampy places, regardless of soaked shoes
and stockings, pushing through wet bushes and
underneath dripping branches, possessed by the
one idea of flight. Down through the hollow where
they had gathered the forget-me-nots, and up the
bluebell bank they struggled, with never a thought
for the flowers; and they were just about to scramble
over some felled trees when Raymonde, who was
a yard in advance, caught her foot in a tangle of
brier and fell on her hands and knees among the
springing bracken. Fauvette, unable to stop herself,
collided heavily and collapsed by her side.
Too much out of breath to stir, the girls lay for
a few moments panting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hallo! Wait!&#8221; shouted their pursuer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>The rather rasping, authoritative voice was so
well known and familiar that the girls scrambled
up and turned round, to find&mdash;no desperate villain
armed with revolver and bowie-knife, but Miss
Gibbs, in a neat, shiny-black mackintosh and
rainproof hat to match. She advanced breathless
and agitated, and very decidedly out of temper.</p>
<p>&#8220;You naughty girls! What do you mean by
running away like this? I watched you through
my telescope as you went to the wood, and of
course followed you. Why didn&#8217;t you come at
once when I called?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know it was you!&#8221; murmured Raymonde,
forbearing to explain that they had taken
their mistress for a ruffian.</p>
<p>Fauvette said nothing. She was looking horribly
conscious and caught. Miss Gibbs glared at
the guilty pair, and, telling them curtly to come
along, led the way back.</p>
<p>Such a serious breach of school discipline was
naturally visited with heavy consequences. For the
next three days Raymonde and Fauvette spent their
recreation hours indoors, copying certain classic
lines of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. They were debarred from
the purchase of chocolates or any other form of
sweetstuff for the period of a month, and made to
understand that they were under the ban not only
of Miss Gibbs&#8217;s, but also of Miss Beasley&#8217;s displeasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought of that wretched telescope,&#8221;
mourned Fauvette. &#8220;Just imagine Gibbie spying
on us all the time! She must have watched us
scramble over the palings into the wood. It&#8217;s
worse than second sight! And then for her to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
come gallivanting out after us in that swanky mackintosh!
It gave me spasms!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d a jinky time, though, first. It was worth
being caught afterwards,&#8221; maintained Raymonde
candidly. &#8220;And, you know, in secret the Bumble
Bee was rejoiced to see that bog bean. She won&#8217;t
admit it, of course, but I know it&#8217;s the discovery of
the term. It&#8217;s recorded in the Nature Note-book,
and the best piece was pressed for the museum.
My own private opinion is that both the Bumble
and the Wasp will go buzzing off to that Limberlost,
exploring on their own, some day, and I don&#8217;t
blame them. It&#8217;s a paradise!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most top-hole place I&#8217;ve ever been in in my
life!&#8221; agreed Fauvette, sighing heavily. &#8220;I say,
I call it rather appropriate of the Bumble to have
made us copy out <i>Paradise Lost</i>!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>Raymonde Explores</h3>
</div>
<p>There was no doubt that Marlowe Grange was
one of the quaintest old houses in the county. The
girls all felt that its medi&aelig;val atmosphere was unrivalled.
Even such prosaic subjects as geometry
or analysis took on an element of romance when
studied in an oak-panelled chamber with coats of
arms emblazoned on the upper panes of the windows.
It was the fashion in the school to rejoice in
the antique surroundings. The girls took numerous
photos, and printed picture post-cards to send
home to their families and friends, and everyone
with the least aptitude for drawing started a sketchbook.
Like most ancient buildings, the old hall,
while preserving its principal rooms in good repair,
was growing shaky in the upper stories. The
labyrinth of attics that lay under the roof had been
neglected till the latticed windows were almost off
their hinges, and the plaster had fallen in great
patches from the ceilings. Fearing lest the worm-eaten
floors were really unsafe, Miss Beasley had
made the top story a forbidden territory, and, to
ensure her orders being obeyed, had placed a wire
door to shut it off from the rest of the house. This
door was kept locked, Miss Beasley and Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
Gibbs each having a key. Every day, girls pressed
inquisitive noses against the wire netting to peep at
the tantalizing prospect beyond. They could just
see round the corner of a winding oak staircase on
to a dim, mysterious landing beyond. Once or
twice Miss Gibbs had gone to her attic laboratory
and had left the door open behind her, and a few
bold spirits had ventured upstairs, but, as the door
of her room had also been wide open, they had not
dared to pass it and risk discovery, and had been
obliged to beat a hasty retreat. It was highly
aggravating, for the vista of dark passages looked
most alluring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we ask the Bumble to take us round
the attics some Saturday for a special treat?&#8221; suggested
Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t be much fun going in a specially
conducted party like a crowd of tourists!&#8221; sniffed
Raymonde. &#8220;We&#8217;d all have to stand at attention
while the Bumble gave a short lecture on the architecture
or the historical significance of some thingumbobs.
It would just turn it all into a lesson.
What I want is to go and poke about on my own;
and I mean to some day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gibbie&#8217;d snap your head off if she caught
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to be caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was all very well to lay plans, but another
matter to carry them out. Miss Gibbs usually
locked the wire door behind her, only leaving it
open when she went upstairs to fetch something
and meant to return almost immediately. The mere
fact of its difficulty increased Raymonde&#8217;s zest for
the adventure. Her wild, harum-scarum spirits
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
welcomed the element of possible danger, and the
imminence of discovery added an extra spice. For
days she haunted the vicinity of the winding staircase,
hiding in bedrooms and watching, in case
Miss Gibbs went to her laboratory. Twice she
watched the mistress pass through the wire door
and lock it safely behind her, quite unaware of the
outraged pupil fuming in No. 3 Dormitory opposite.
Raymonde reiterated her old opinion that Miss
Gibbs was far too exact and conscientious.</p>
<p>On one eventful afternoon, however, fortune
favoured her. No less a person than Miss Beasley
ascended the interesting staircase, actually leaving
the defences unsecured. Raymonde seized the
opportunity, and like a little ghost or shadow stole
softly after her. The head mistress had entered
the laboratory, and had closed that door after her.
Raymonde tiptoed up to it, and could hear voices
inside, the whirling of a wheel, and a kind of bubbling
sound. Was Miss Beasley assisting Miss
Gibbs with the alchemy? She did not wait even to
take a survey through the keyhole, but, hurrying
on, turned the corner of the passage.</p>
<p>She found herself in another long, narrow landing,
with rooms on both sides. She peeped into
most of these. They were empty, and in a deplorable
state of disrepair. Plaster had fallen
from the ceilings, showing the rafters; in some
places, even streaks of daylight shone through
chinks in the tiled roof. The worm-eaten old floors
had rotted into holes, and Raymonde had to walk
warily to avoid putting her foot through in tender
places. Many of the rooms had cupboards&mdash;dark,
mysterious, cobwebby recesses&mdash;into which she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
peered with a rather jumpy sensation that a bogy
might suddenly pop out. The whole atmosphere
of the place was ghostly, even in the daytime.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like to come up here at night!&#8221;
shivered Raymonde.</p>
<p>As far as she could tell, the passage seemed to
be leading her round the house. It turned several
corners, and ended in a long gallery. This looked
more cheerful, for the sun shone in through the
large end window and brightened the cracked old
walls. She danced along the floor with quite a
return of high spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish the Bumble would let us come up here
on wet days. It would be a glorious place for
games, nicer by far than the barn. I call it mean
of her to lock up all this part of the house. We&#8217;d
have absolutely topping fun! I say! what&#8217;s that
little door over there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The door in question was very small, and quite
low down on a level with the floor. Raymonde
went on her hands and knees to investigate. It
was secured with a bolt, which she easily opened.
To her surprise, she found herself looking out upon
the roof. Whether it had been constructed in past
days to provide a means of escape from danger, or
merely to allow workmen to replace loose tiles, it
was impossible to say. It was certainly within the
bounds of probability to imagine a Jacobite, with
a price set on his life, creeping through the little
opening to find a more secure hiding-place among
the twisted chimneys, while King George&#8217;s soldiers
searched the mansion below.</p>
<p>Raymonde put her head out. The roof sloped
steeply up in front. To a girl of her temperament
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
the temptation to explore farther was irresistible.
She squeezed through the small door, and wriggled
out on her hands and knees on to the tiles.</p>
<p>She was in the angle of a small gable. She
could see roof all round her, and sky above. Still
on hands and knees, she began to creep upwards.
The weather-beaten old tiles had mellowed to dull
red and orange, and were partly covered with moss.
She could not help admiring the artistic beauty of
their colour. She reached the ridge, and peered
over. Apparently she was somewhere in the middle
of the roof, for a tall, twisted stack of chimneys
reared itself close by, and gables spread on all
sides. She went cautiously down the next incline,
and up to the summit of a further ridge, which was
higher. Here, by standing up and holding on to
a chimney ledge, she had an excellent view. She
could not see the courtyard, but she could command
the bottom of the orchard, the moat, the fields that
led to the river, and the cliffs and woods beyond.
It was quite a bird&#8217;s-eye prospect. She seemed to be
looking on to the top of everything. The cattle in
the meadows appeared mere specks, and a cart and
horses passing over the bridge were like a child&#8217;s
toy. It was fascinating to watch them vanishing
down the road.</p>
<p>Raymonde was in no hurry to return. She stood
for quite a long time enjoying an exhilarating sense
of being on the summit of a mountain. At last the
recollection that it must be nearly preparation time
recalled her to the necessity of departure. With
a sigh of regret she dropped back on to the ridge,
and crawled over the gables again. She was sure
that she had left the little door open behind her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
but when she approached it she saw that it was
shut. Perhaps the wind had blown it to. She
put out her hand to fling it open, but it did not
yield. She pushed harder, pressing with all her
force. It remained immovable. Then the awful
truth burst upon her. Somebody had latched the
door on the inside, and she was locked out upon
the roof. Had Miss Beasley or Miss Gibbs been
taking a survey of the attics? No matter who it
was, the horrible result remained the same. What
was she to do? She beat wildly at the door, hoping
to break it in, but sixteenth-century oak and bolts
were made of stuff too strong for a girl&#8217;s hands.
She shouted and called, knowing all the time that
it was of little avail. Whoever bolted the door
must have gone away. Miss Gibbs&#8217;s laboratory
was at the other side of the house, and she might
scream herself hoarse without anyone hearing her.
For a minute or two she sat huddled up in despair.
Would she have to spend the night on the roof?</p>
<p>It was a ghastly prospect. Hot tears came
welling up, but she dashed them away angrily.
Her innate pluck rose to the surface. She had
been in difficult, even dangerous positions before,
and had escaped. Surely there must be some way
out of this?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll climb farther on over the roof,&#8221; she decided.
&#8220;If I can get nearer the edge, perhaps someone
may see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chance of rescue meant admitting her adventure,
and incurring great wrath at head-quarters,
but that was a lesser evil than passing a night on
the roof. She crawled to her old vantage-ground,
and descended to the right, where a gable sloped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
steeply. At the bottom she passed along a wide
gutter, and, rounding a corner, found that she could
easily drop on to a lower portion of the roof. She
was in a state of tense excitement. Where was
she getting to? Would anybody see her from the
courtyard; and if so, how would they propose to
rescue her? It would be difficult to shout down
and explain that she had come through the little
door in the upper gallery. She was on a much
lower level now than when she had first started.
She crawled on, with hands and knees rather sore
and scraped with the tiles.</p>
<p>Another corner, and another short drop. She
was nearing the edge of the parapet. She must
creep down this next piece of roof. There was
another wide gutter at the bottom. She walked
along this, rounded a jutting chimney-stack, and
then paused with a cry. Facing her was a small
door, identical with the one by which she had
emerged. Could it possibly be open? She stumbled
up to it, and pressed it with trembling fingers. It
yielded easily. The next moment she was creeping
through.</p>
<p>Raymonde now found herself inside a cupboard
full of old lumber. The dust was thick, and surely
had not been disturbed for years. Some broken
chairs with moth-eaten seats were piled together,
and some ancient boxes lay full of rubbish. Straw,
old books, hanks of rope, and other miscellaneous
things occupied the corner. There was a door
opposite, without either latch or knob. Raymonde
with some difficulty managed to pull it open, and
stepped out into a passage. When she pushed the
door to behind her, she noticed that it fitted so exactly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
into the oak panelling as to be quite undiscernible.
Could it be a secret cupboard? She
wondered if Miss Beasley knew of its existence.
There was a window close by; she looked out and
took her bearings. Apparently she was just over
the big dormitory; the tiles across which she had
crawled to enter the cupboard must have been those
of Miss Gibbs&#8217;s bedroom. The landing where she
found herself at present led to the servants&#8217; quarters;
the staircase was to her right.</p>
<p>Raymonde hurried down without meeting anybody,
washed the dust and dirt off her hands,
and walked in to preparation in the very nick of
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>Fifth-Form Tactics</h3>
</div>
<p>It was an unfortunate truth that Miss Gibbs was
not very popular at the Grange. She was clever,
conscientious, and well-meaning, and preserved a
high ideal of girlhood. Much too high for practical
use, so her pupils maintained.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a school for saints!&#8221; grumbled
Valentine one day. &#8220;If we followed all Gibbie&#8217;s
pet precepts we should have halos round our
heads.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And be sprouting wings!&#8221; added Raymonde.
&#8220;A very uncomfortable process too. I expect it
would hurt like cutting teeth, and it would spoil
the fit of one&#8217;s blouses. I don&#8217;t want to be an
angel! I&#8217;m quite content with this world at
present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so tired of developing my capabilities!&#8221;
sighed Fauvette. &#8220;One never gets half an hour
now, just to have fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs, who aspired to a partnership in the
school, was deeply concerned this term with the
general culture and mental outlook of her charges.
She had attended an educational congress during
the Easter holidays, and came back primed with the
very latest theories. She was determined to work on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
the most modern methods, and to turn her pupils
out into the world, a little band of ardent thinkers,
keen-witted, self-sacrificing, logical, anxious for the
development of their sex, yearning for careers, in
fact the vanguard of a new womanhood. Unfortunately
her material was not altogether promising.
A few earnest spirits, such as Maudie Heywood,
responded to her appeals, but the generality were
slow to move. They listened to her impassioned
addresses on women&#8217;s suffrage without a spark of
animation, and sat stolidly while she descanted
upon the bad conditions of labour among munition
girls, and the need for lady welfare workers. The
fact was that her pupils did not care an atom about
the position of their sex, a half-holiday was far
more to them than the vote, and their own grievances
loomed larger than those of factory hands.
They considered that they had a very decided
grievance at present.</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs, acting on the advice of a book entitled
<i>Education out of School Hours</i>, was determined
that every moment of the day should be filled with
some occupation that led to culture. She carefully
explained that the word &#8220;recreation&#8221; meant &#8220;re-creation&#8221;&mdash;a
creating again, not a mere period of
frivolity or lotus-eating, and advocated that all
intervals of leisure should be devoted to intellectual
interests. She frowned on girls who sauntered
arm-in-arm round the garden, or sat giggling in
the summer-house, and suggested suitable employments
for their idle hands and brains. &#8220;Never
waste a precious minute&#8221; was her motto, and the
girls groaned under it. Healthy hobbies were all
very well, but to be urged to ride them in season
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and out of season was distinctly trying. One well-meant
effort on Miss Gibbs&#8217;s part met with particular
disapproval. She had decided to take the girls on
Saturday afternoons to visit various old castles,
Roman camps, and other objects of historical and
arch&aelig;ological interest in the neighbourhood. On
former similar occasions she had been in the habit
of delivering a short lecture when on the spot; but,
noticing that many of the girls were so distracted
with gazing at the surroundings that they were not
really listening, she determined that they should
absorb the knowledge before visiting the place.
She wrote careful notes, therefore, upon the subject
of their next ramble, and giving them out in class,
ordered each girl to copy them and to commit them
to memory.</p>
<p>The result of her injunction was an outburst of
almost mutinous indignation in Form V.</p>
<p>&#8220;When does she expect us to do it, I should like
to know?&#8221; raged Morvyth. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a moment
to spare in prep., so I suppose it will have to come
out of our so-called recreation! Look here, I call
this the very limit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saturday afternoon&#8217;s no holiday when we&#8217;ve
got to go prowling round a wretched Roman
camp!&#8221; mourned Valentine. &#8220;What do I care
about ancient earthworks? If they were modern
trenches, now, with soldiers in them, it would be
something like! There&#8217;ll be nothing to see except
some mounds. I suppose we shall have to stand
round and listen while she holds forth, and look
&#8216;intelligent&#8217; and &#8216;interested&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether she&#8217;s going to hold forth
herself,&#8221; said Aveline. &#8220;I hear she&#8217;s invited several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
people from an arch&aelig;ological society to meet us
there, and probably one of them will do the spouting&mdash;some
wheezy old gentleman with a bald head,
or an elderly lady in a waterproof and spectacles.
One knows the sort!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, good biz!&#8221; exclaimed Raymonde. &#8220;If
visitors are coming, Gibbie&#8217;ll have to talk to them,
and she won&#8217;t have so much time to look after us.
She&#8217;s welcome to the bald old boys! Let her have
half a dozen if she wants!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget you&#8217;ve got to listen to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll listen! At least I&#8217;ll look serious and
politely absorbed. That&#8217;s all that&#8217;s expected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the meantime we&#8217;ve these wretched notes to
copy,&#8221; groused Katherine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have we? I don&#8217;t think so! I&#8217;ve got an idea.
Maudie Heywood&#8217;s sure to make a most beautiful
copperplate copy; we&#8217;ll borrow hers, and just skim
them over to get a kind of general acquaintance
with the subject, sufficient to show &#8216;intelligent
interest&#8217;. Gibbie won&#8217;t be able to question us with
those other people there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose she asks beforehand to see our
notes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that. We&#8217;ll each copy out the
first page, and stick some old exercise sheets behind
it. She&#8217;ll never find out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mystic Seven looked at their leader in admiration.
They considered that on such occasions
her resourcefulness amounted to genius. They followed
her advice, and copied the front page only
of the notes, placing underneath some portions of
Latin translation or historical essay. Aveline underlined
her title with red ink, Morvyth ruled a neat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
margin, and Fauvette tied her sheets together with
a piece of the blue baby ribbon which she used
for threading through her underclothes. On the
outside, at any rate, their copies looked most presentable.</p>
<p>It was only the Fifth Form who were accorded
the privilege of the ramble. They were Miss
Gibbs&#8217;s special charge this term, Miss Beasley
devoting herself to the Sixth, and Mademoiselle
looking after the Juniors. The Fifth hardly appreciated
receiving the lion&#8217;s share of Miss Gibbs&#8217;s
attention. They complained that she tried all her
educational experiments upon them. They were
ready, however, the whole ten of them, on Saturday
afternoon, clad in the neat school uniform, brown
serge skirt, khaki blouse, scarlet tie, and burnt-straw
hat. Miss Gibbs viewed them with approval.
Each had slung over her shoulders a vasculum for
botanical or other specimens, and each carried in
her hand a copy of the notes. They looked business-like,
healthy, well trained, and alert with
intelligence, altogether an excellent advertisement
for the school and its modern methods.</p>
<p>The camp was about a two-mile walk from the
Grange, so the Form had at least the satisfaction of
obtaining exercise. As Valentine had prophesied,
it consisted of some mounds in the middle of a
field, where, to Fauvette&#8217;s infinite discomposure,
some cows were grazing. The members of the
Arch&aelig;ological Society had already arrived, and
came forward to greet Miss Gibbs. There was a
large stout gentleman, with a grey moustache and
bushy overhanging eyebrows; also a little thin
gentleman with a pointed beard and an argumentative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
voice; a tall lady with a high colour, who carried
a guide-book, and a short-sighted younger man,
who was trying to spread out an ordnance map.
These seemed to be the principal members of the
party, though there were a few stragglers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Edwards&mdash;my girls!&#8221; said Miss
Gibbs, introducing the Form <i>en bloc</i> to the leader
for the afternoon.</p>
<p>The stout gentleman smiled blandly, and murmured
some suitable remark about the value of
acquiring antiquarian tastes while still young.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had perhaps better read my short paper before
we inspect the remains,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goody! He surely isn&#8217;t going to disinter any
dead Romans to show us, is he?&#8221; whispered
Katherine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bunkum!&#8221; replied Ardiune. &#8220;Nothing as
thrilling as that, don&#8217;t you fear!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs smiled encouragingly to the Form,
and beckoned them to draw nearer. They arranged
themselves in a respectful semicircle, with attentive
eyes fixed on the lecturer, and copies of notes
rather conspicuously flaunted.</p>
<p>He discoursed exhaustively on the subject of
Roman camps in general, and the girls listened
with receptive faces, but minds wandering upon
more modern themes. Morvyth was speculating
whether it would be possible to purchase chocolates
on the way home, Fauvette was planning her next
party frock, and Aveline was wondering whether
there would be jam or honey for tea that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I ask you to take a personal survey
of the earthworks,&#8221; concluded the Professor, &#8220;I
should like to have Miss Gibbs&#8217;s opinion as to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
exact position of the entrance and the approximate
date of construction. She has, I know, made a
study of this branch of arch&aelig;ology.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My ideas are embodied in my notes,&#8221; purred
Miss Gibbs. &#8220;Perhaps you would not mind reading
the paragraph. I lent them a short time ago
to Mrs. Gladwin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Professor Edwards turned expectantly; but the
tall lady, who a moment before had been at his
elbow, had strayed away, papers in hand, and was
not available for reference.</p>
<p>&#8220;My girls all have copies of the notes. Pass
yours, Ardiune,&#8221; smiled the mistress.</p>
<p>The luckless Ardiune blushed scarlet, but dared
not disobey.</p>
<p>&#8220;The passage occurs about the middle,&#8221; prompted
Miss Gibbs, as the Professor fumbled with the
pages. &#8220;May I find it for you? Why, surely
there must be some mistake! This is French!
Valentine, your copy, child!&#8221;</p>
<p>With an even more crimson countenance Valentine
tendered her manuscript, which consisted of
last week&#8217;s essay on Comets. Miss Gibbs, with a
growing tightness round her lips, inspected Raymonde&#8217;s
extracts from Chaucer, and Katherine&#8217;s
translation of Virgil, before Aveline had the presence
of mind to hand up Maudie Heywood&#8217;s copy.
It is unwise for a mistress to show temper before
visitors, and Miss Gibbs, with admirable self-control,
mastered her feelings and read the paragraph
calmly. During the discussion which followed, the
girls availed themselves of an invitation from the
short-sighted gentleman to inspect the earthworks,
and thankfully fled to the farthest limits of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
field. They knew, of course, that it was only
putting off the evil hour, and further events justified
their forebodings. Miss Gibbs preserved an
ominous silence on the way home, and after tea
summoned the Form to their class-room, where she
went into exhaustive details of the whole business.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disgusted with you&mdash;utterly disgusted!&#8221;
she declared. &#8220;It seems of little use to spend time
in attempting to give you intellectual interests.
Those girls who did not copy the notes will stay
in now and write them. I shall look at them all at
eight o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means a good solid hour&#8217;s work,&#8221; whispered
Raymonde to Ardiune. &#8220;Tennis is off to-night.
Strafe the old camp! I wish the Romans had
never lived!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A Midnight Scare</h3>
</div>
<p>Miss Gibbs&#8217;s plans for the enlargement of her
pupils&#8217; minds ran over a wide range of subjects
from arch&aelig;ology to ambulance. As they expressed
it, she was always springing some fresh surprise
upon them. Like bees, they were expected to sip
mental honey from many intellectual flowers. They
had dabbled in chemistry till Ardiune spilt acid
down Miss Gibbs&#8217;s dress, after which the experiments
suddenly stopped. They had collected fruits
and seed-vessels, had studied animalcul&aelig; through
the microscope, and modelled fungi in plasticine.
Stencilling, illuminating, painting, and marqueterie
each had a brief turn, and were superseded
by raffia-plaiting and poker-work. Miss Beasley
suggested tentatively that it might be better to concentrate
on a single subject, but Miss Gibbs, who
loved arguments about education, was well prepared
to defend her line of action.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is always a danger in specialization,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell how a girl&#8217;s tastes
will run till you give her an opportunity of proving
them. My theory is, let them try each separate
craft, and then choose their own hobbies. One
will take naturally to oil-painting, another may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
find clay or gesso her means of artistic expression.
Some minds delight in pure Greek outline, while
others revel in the intricacies of Celtic ornament.
Again, a girl with no &aelig;sthetic sense may be enraptured
with the wonders of the microscope, and
those who find a difficulty in mastering the technical
terms of botany may yet excel in the extent of
their collections of specimens. Who would have
imagined that Veronica Terry would develop an
interest in geology? I had always considered her
a remarkably dull child, but her fossils formed the
nucleus of the school museum. I have hopes at
present that one or two of my girls are developing
tastes that will last them for life.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was one of Miss Gibbs&#8217;s pet theories that not
only should her pupils have the opportunity of
sampling arts, handicrafts, and scientific pursuits,
but that they should in every respect cultivate a
wide mental horizon. She was fond of suggesting
emergencies to them, and asking how they would
act in special circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine yourself left a widow,&#8221; she had once
propounded, &#8220;with three small children to support,
and a capital of only three hundred pounds.
How would you employ this sum to the best advantage,
so as to provide some future means of
subsistence for yourself and family?&#8221;</p>
<p>The opinions of the Form had been interesting,
and had varied from poultry farming to the establishment
of a boarding-house or the setting up of
tea-rooms. The most original suggestion, however,
was contributed by Fauvette, and, while it
outraged Miss Gibbs&#8217;s sense of propriety, caused
infinite hilarity in the Form.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I were left a widow,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;I should
get the children into orphanages, or persuade rich
friends to adopt them. Then I would spend the
three hundred pounds in buying new clothes and
staying at the best hotels, and try to get married
again to somebody who could provide for me
better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the flights of fancy in which the Fifth
Form were forced to indulge were a railway collision,
a fire, a bicycle accident, an escape of gas, the
swallowing of poison, the bursting of the kitchen
boiler, a case of choking, and an infectious epidemic.
On the whole they rather enjoyed the fun
of airing their views, and when asked to propose
fresh topics had suggested such startling catastrophes
as &#8220;A German Invasion,&#8221; &#8220;A Revolution,&#8221;
&#8220;A Volcanic Eruption,&#8221; &#8220;A Famine,&#8221; and &#8220;A
Zeppelin Raid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rejecting the first four, Miss Gibbs had chosen
the last for discussion, and for fully ten minutes the
Form, in imagination, dwelt in an atmosphere of
explosives. They clutched their few valuables that
were within reach, donned dressing-gowns and bedroom
slippers, each seized a blanket, and all descended
to the cellars with the utmost dispatch of
which they were capable, while bombs came crashing
through the roof, and the walls of the house
tottered to ruin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never dare to go to sleep again!&#8221;
shivered Fauvette, appalled at the mental picture
presented to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the Zepps likely to come, Miss Gibbs?&#8221;
enquired Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so likely at this time of year as in winter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Still, of course, one never can tell,&#8221; replied the mistress,
anxious to justify the usefulness of her emergency
lessons. &#8220;It is wise to know what to do.
We ought all to adopt the Boy Scouts&#8217; motto&mdash;&#8216;Be
Prepared&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose we ever do hear dreadful noises in
the middle of the night?&#8221; said Raymonde, gazing
with solemn, awestruck eyes at the teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must make for the cellar without
delay,&#8221; replied Miss Gibbs emphatically.</p>
<p>If she could have seen Raymonde&#8217;s expression,
as that young lady turned her head for a moment
towards Aveline, she would have been surprised.
The serious apprehension had changed to dancing
mischief. Even so well-seasoned a mistress as Miss
Gibbs, however, cannot be aware of every sub-current
in her Form. Human nature has its limits.</p>
<p>Raymonde left the class-room chuckling to herself,
and at the earliest convenient moment summoned
a committee of the Mystic Seven.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the idea of my life!&#8221; she declared.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t often I have a really topping notion, but
this is one of those inspirations that come sometimes,
one doesn&#8217;t know how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be quite so peacocky about it!&#8221;
chirruped Katherine. &#8220;Other people have ideas
occasionally as well as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! but wait till you&#8217;ve heard mine, and then
you&#8217;ll allow I&#8217;ve some reason to cock-a-doodle.
Look here, don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s extremely nice to be
philanthropic?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied the others doubtfully.
They distrusted Raymonde&#8217;s philanthropy, and
were unwilling to commit themselves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so nice to do things for others,&#8221; continued
their schoolmate gushingly. &#8220;When somebody
has been looking forward to an event, just think of
the bliss of being able to bring it to pass! One
would feel a sort of mixture of Santa Claus and
Cinderella&#8217;s Fairy Godmother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; murmured the Mystics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you see, what I mean is this. Gibbie&#8217;s
been taking ever such a lot of trouble to teach us
how to act in emergencies. She must have spent
hours thinking out those problems. I sometimes
feel, girls, that we do not sufficiently appreciate our
teachers!&#8221;</p>
<p>The grimaces of the six were eloquent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get to the point!&#8221; suggested Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting! Well, you know, we&#8217;re all very
grateful to Gibbie, and interested in the problems,
and happy in our work, and all the rest of it. I
think we ought to do something to make a little
return to her for her kindness. Now it must be
very disappointing to coach us up for these emergencies,
and never have an opportunity of putting
what we&#8217;ve been taught into practice. If we could
show her that her lessons have sunk in, and that we
could face a sudden catastrophe with calm courage
and prompt presence of mind, then she&#8217;d feel her
labour had not been in vain. She really deserves
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t burst the kitchen boiler, or set the
cook on fire to oblige her!&#8221; objected Valentine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not; but there are other emergencies.
With proper preparation we might engineer a
very neat little Zepp raid, quite sufficient to put
every theory into practice.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Smiles illuminated the faces of the committee.
They began to see daylight. Raymonde re-tied
her hair ribbon, and continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;On that afternoon when I went exploring, I
discovered a way on to the roof exactly over
Gibbie&#8217;s bedroom. Now what you&#8217;ve got to do
for the next few days is to collect old tins. There
ought to be plenty of them about. You can leave
the rest to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>The result of Raymonde&#8217;s suggestion was an
extraordinary activity on the part of her friends in
the acquisition of any species of discarded can.
They begged empty cocoa tins from the cook, and
even climbed over the wall on to the rubbish heap
to rescue specimens, rusty or otherwise, that lay
there unnoticed and unappropriated. Each can
was furnished with four or five large pebbles inside,
and was secured at the end with brown paper if the
original lid was lost. They were packed in osier-plaited
baskets, and hidden away in a corner of the
barn until they were wanted.</p>
<p>Raymonde regarded her preparations with much
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to be enough to wake the dead!&#8221; she
said, rattling one of the tins in demonstration.</p>
<p>As has been before explained, the members of
the Fourth and Fifth Forms&mdash;nineteen girls in all&mdash;slept
in the huge chamber which occupied an
entire wing of the house, and had been the dormitory
of the French nuns a hundred years ago.
The small room at the end, formerly the cell of the
Mother Superior, was now the bower of Miss
Gibbs. It had two doors, one leading into the
passage and another into the dormitory, so that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
could keep an eye upon the nineteen inmates. It
was a very unnecessary arrangement to have her
so near, the girls considered, for she would come
popping in immediately if they made a noise. They
envied the Sixth, who slept in little bedrooms along
the corridor, and wished Miss Gibbs had possessed
a lesser sense of duty and a greater appreciation of
luxury, so that she might have chosen a more comfortable
and spacious bedroom elsewhere.</p>
<p>When sufficient tin-can ammunition had been
prepared, Raymonde carried the baskets upstairs
by stealth, and hid them in the lumber cupboard
which she had discovered on the day she had
explored the roof. They were not likely to be
disturbed here, for probably no one save herself
knew of the existence of the tiny room. She crept
through the small door on to the tiles, and verified
her position by cautious tapping, to which Morvyth,
stationed in the passage below with a hockey stick,
replied. Having thus taken her exact bearings,
she felt that the whole plot was in good training.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must choose a moonlight night, or I
shouldn&#8217;t be able to see my way over the roof,&#8221;
she informed the committee. &#8220;Of course Zepps
don&#8217;t generally come when there&#8217;s a moon, but
there&#8217;ll be no time for anybody to think of that.
You know your part of the business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ra&mdash;ther!&#8221;</p>
<p>The household at the Grange retired early to
rest. Miss Gibbs, who was an ardent advocate
of daylight saving, and always rose at six, was
generally in bed by eleven, on the theory that it
is impossible to burn a candle at both ends. As
a rule, every occupant of the long dormitory was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
wrapt in slumber before that hour, and the mistress,
taking a last peep at the rows of small beds,
would hear nothing but peaceful breathing. On
one particular evening, however, when she made
her usual survey of the room, seven of the apparent
sleepers were foxing. They lay with closed eyes
and composed faces, but inwardly they were particularly
lively. Each one had solemnly passed
her word to keep awake, and considered herself on
sentry duty. To pass the time they had brought
acid drops to bed with them, and sucked them
slowly, so as to make them last as long as possible.
They dared not talk, for fear of disturbing the
others, though the temptation was great. Occasionally
a stealthy hand would reach over to the
next bed, to make sure of its occupant&#8217;s vigilance,
and the squeeze would be passed on down the row
of seven.</p>
<p>When the old grandfather clock on the stairs
chimed midnight, Raymonde and Morvyth rose
quietly, and donned dressing-gowns and bedroom
slippers, then, with a final signal to their fellow
mystics, crept cautiously out of the room. The
passage was very dark, but Morvyth had brought
her electric torch, and flashed a ray of light in
front of them. It felt decidedly spooky, and they
were thankful to be together. They went up the
stairs towards the servants&#8217; quarters, and along
an upper landing. By the aid of the torch it was
not difficult to find the secret door among the
panelling. The little lumber-room looked horribly
dark; it needed an effort of will to enter
among its dim shadows. A rat was gnawing in
the corner, and scurried away with noise enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
for a lion. Raymonde peeped through the small
door on to the roof. Outside, the moon was shining
brilliantly. She could see each separate tile
as clearly as by daylight. The sight restored her
courage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll creep through, and then you hand me the
baskets,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I know just the place
to drop the tins. They&#8217;ll go plump, and roll down
the whole length of the gable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o, old sport!&#8221; returned Morvyth.</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs lay in her bedroom, sleeping the
sleep of the just. The moonlight, flooding through
her hygienically wide-open window, revealed the
rows of photographs on her chimney-piece, the gilt-edged
volumes on her book-shelf, and the little
emergency medicine cupboard on the wall. Was
she dreaming of the lesson she meant to give to-morrow,
or of the officer whose portrait, in the
silver frame, occupied the post of honour in her
picture gallery? Who could tell? Unsympathetic
school-girls do not know all the secrets of a teacher&#8217;s
life. Perhaps Miss Gibbs, like the familiar chestnut
burr, hid a silver lining under her prickly
exterior. She slept so peacefully&mdash;it was a shame
to disturb her. Schoolgirls are ruthless beings at
best.</p>
<p>Bang! Rattle! Bang! Bump! She woke with
a start. Projectiles were falling upon the roof with
terrific force. At the same moment shrieks issued
from the dormitory, and a wild shout of &#8220;Zepps!&#8221;
Miss Gibbs&#8217;s presence of mind did not desert her.
It took her exactly three seconds to put on her
dressing-gown and bedroom slippers, two more to
sweep her watch, purse, and a little packet of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
treasures (placed nightly in readiness) into the
ample pocket of her wrapper, and the next instant
she was flashing her torchlight in the dormitory.</p>
<p>The girls, most of them very scared, were turning
out of bed; Aveline, Fauvette, Valentine, Ardiune,
and Katherine were already garbed, and encouraging
the others. Before a minute and a half had
elapsed, the whole party was on its way to the
cellar, having rung the great bell on the stairs
to warn the rest of the household.</p>
<p>Raymonde and Morvyth, having expended the
ammunition, hurried downstairs, and slipped in
among their Form mates unobserved. The school
spent an agitated hour in the cellar, sitting on
blankets clutched from their beds. As all appeared
quiet, and no more mysterious thumps
resounded on the roof, Miss Beasley, who had reconnoitred,
declared it safe to return to roost, and
ordered her twenty-six pupils upstairs again. Possibly
she had her suspicions, for very early next
morning she went out to investigate the extent of
the damage, and discovered a selection of the projectiles
lying on the lawn. The result was a solemn
harangue to the whole school.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who has played this contemptible
practical joke,&#8221; she proclaimed witheringly. &#8220;It
may seem humorous to small minds, but to me it
is pitiable. There were no doubt instigators amongst
you, and for the sake of those ringleaders I shall
punish you all. You will spend Wednesday afternoon
in your class-rooms copying out &#8216;Lycidas,&#8217;
instead of taking our projected trip on the river.
It is hard to punish the innocent with the guilty,
but those responsible for this occurrence are probably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
known to their companions, who will, I hope,
visit their displeasure upon them, and cause them
to regret that they have deprived the school of a
holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Beasley&#8217;s method of punishment, though
voted abominably unfair by the majority, was certainly
efficacious. Such grave suspicion fell on the
Mystic Seven that the indignant monitresses took
the matter in hand, and insisted on investigating
the entire business. Popular opinion raged hotly
against the culprits, for the promised expedition to
the river had been regarded as the treat of the
term.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it&#8217;s all your fault, Raymonde Armitage!&#8221;
scolded Linda Mottram. &#8220;If there&#8217;s any
mischief about, one may be sure you&#8217;re at the
bottom of it. We don&#8217;t want your monkey tricks
here. They&#8217;re on the level of a kindergarten for
little boys. If anything more of this sort happens,
you may expect to find yourself jolly well boycotted.
I shan&#8217;t speak to you, in any case, for
a week, and I hope none of the other monitresses
will. You deserve sending to Coventry by everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How hard it is to be public-spirited!&#8221; mourned
Raymonde to her chums afterwards. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
I gave everybody a treat, and especially Gibbie.
I&#8217;m a martyr to the cause of emergencies. For
goodness&#8217; sake don&#8217;t any of you drink poison by
mistake, or they&#8217;ll lay the blame on me and send
me to the gallows!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>The Crystal Gazers</h3>
</div>
<p>It was about this time that a wave of the occult
passed over the school. It began with Daphne
Johnson, who happened to read a magazine article
on &#8220;The Borderland of the Spirit World,&#8221; and it
spread like an epidemic of influenza. The supernatural
was the topic of the hour. Ghost stories
were at a premium, and any girl who could relate
some creepy spiritual experience, which had happened
to the second cousin of a friend of a friend
of hers, was sure of a thrilled audience. This taste
for the psychic was particularly strong among the
girls of the Sixth Form, who leaned towards its
intellectual and scientific aspects. They despised
vulgar apparitions, but discussed such abstruse
problems as phantasms of the living, thought transference,
will power, hypnotism, and clairvoyance.
Meta Wright dabbled a little in palmistry, and
examined the hands of her schoolmates, prophesying
startling events in their future careers. Lois
Barlow sent half-a-crown to a ladies&#8217; newspaper
to have her horoscope cast, and was terribly dejected
at the gloomy prospects offered her by the
planets, till she fortunately discovered that she had
put the date of her birth wrong by three hours,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
which would, of course, completely alter the aspect
of the heavenly bodies, and cause the best of astrologers
to err. Veronica Terry talked darkly of experiences
in the psychic world, of astral bodies,
etheric doubles, elemental entities, and nature
spirits. She went to sleep at night with her thumbs
and big toes crossed, in the hope of bringing back
the adventures of her dreams into her waking consciousness.
She was a little hazy on the subject,
but yearned for further instruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s called &#8216;Yoga&#8217;,&#8221; she confided to her particular
chum, Barbara Rowlands. &#8220;You concentrate
your mind before you go to sleep, and then
you&#8217;re able to function in the astral body. My
cousin Winnie told me of a girl at College who
did it, and she was seen standing in the room of
a friend at the other side of the hostel, while all the
time she was asleep in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t do that!&#8221; shuddered Barbara
nervously. &#8220;It would give me a fit if I woke up
and found you staring at me, and knew it wasn&#8217;t
really you. Promise you won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be rather difficult to regulate one&#8217;s
movements, once one is out of the body,&#8221; returned
Veronica guardedly.</p>
<p>Barbara did not crave for spiritual excursions,
and secretly preferred the old days, when her chum
talked tennis instead of psychology; but the occult
was paramount, and she was obliged to follow the
fashion. The atmosphere of the Grange was certainly
conducive to superstition. The dim passages
and panelled walls looked haunted. Every accessory
of the old mansion seemed a suitable background
for a ghost. The juniors were frankly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
frightened. They did not dare to go upstairs alone.
They imagined skeleton fingers clutching their
legs through the banisters, or bodiless heads rolling
like billiard balls along the landings. Having
listened, awestruck, to Veronica&#8217;s accounts of a
s&eacute;ance, they were apprehensive lest the tables
should turn sportive and caper about the rooms
rapping out spirit messages, or boisterous elementals
should bump the beds up and down and
fling the china about.</p>
<p>&#8220;That only happens if there&#8217;s a powerful medium
in the house,&#8221; Veronica had assured them, and the
girls devoutly hoped that none of their number
possessed the required mystic properties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Raymonde one day to Ardiune,
&#8220;I&#8217;m getting rather fed up with this spook business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So&#8217;m I,&#8221; agreed Ardiune. &#8220;I thought it was
fun at first, but it&#8217;s got beyond the limit now.
The sillies can talk of nothing else. I&#8217;m sick
of sitting on Veronica&#8217;s bed and hearing about
mediums and messages. I&#8217;d like a potato race
for a change. I vote we get up some progressive
games.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be more jinky! I fancy a good many
are tired of ghosts, only they don&#8217;t like to say so.
Ardiune! I&#8217;ve got an idea! While the school&#8217;s
still mad on these things, why shouldn&#8217;t we have
some fun out of it? Play a rag on them, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dress up in a sheet and rub wet matches on
one&#8217;s hands?&#8221; suggested Ardiune.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/gs02.png' alt='' title='' style='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;'>
&#8220;THE PASSAGE WAS VERY DARK, BUT MORVYTH<br />
HAD BROUGHT HER ELECTRIC TORCH&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, no! Nothing so stale as that! Why, it
would hardly take in the juniors for more than a
minute. I&#8217;m angling for bigger fish. I want to
hook the Sixth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! Not so easy, my good girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It needs craft, of course, and one must have a
suitable bait. The common or garden ghost trick
would be useless. I want something subtle. If
I could have developed mediumistic powers, now,
and gone into a trance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you?&#8221; queried Ardiune eagerly.</p>
<p>Raymonde shook a regretful head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Veronica knows too much about s&eacute;ances. She
says the great test of the trance is to stick pins into
the medium. If she doesn&#8217;t utter a groan, then
her conscious entity is suspended, and a spirit is
about to materialize. I couldn&#8217;t stand being a
living pin-cushion. I know I&#8217;d squeal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we might pad you with cushions. S&eacute;ances
are always held in the dark, so they wouldn&#8217;t find
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trust Veronica to find my vulnerable spot!
She detests me, and she&#8217;d just enjoy prodding me
up with pins. No, we must have something less
painful than that, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Table-turning might be possible?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sixth did it, and the table was beginning
to go round quite nicely when they discovered that
Linda was pushing the leg. I think pretty nearly
everything occult has been tried here lately, except
just one. We&#8217;ve not had any crystal gazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;you do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember that chapter in <i>Zilla, the
Sahara Queen</i>? How she goes to the Coptic
magician, and he pours some ink into a little boy&#8217;s
hand, and sees all her future in it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ink would stain horribly,&#8221; commented Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I don&#8217;t mean to use ink. What I want is
a crystal. There&#8217;s something on Gibbie&#8217;s chimney-piece
that would do jolly well. I believe I&#8217;ll
borrow it! I know just how to manage, because
Mabel and Sylvia went to consult a psychist in
Bond Street, and they told me all about it, and
everything she said and did. As a matter of fact
she described Mabel&#8217;s fianc&eacute; quite wrong, and pretended
she saw him sitting in a dug-out, while all
the time he was on a battleship; but they thought
it great fun, because they hadn&#8217;t really intended to
believe her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would the girls believe you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not as Raymonde Armitage. I don&#8217;t
mean them to know me. We&#8217;re going to disguise
ourselves, so that our very mothers wouldn&#8217;t own
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ardiune looked decidedly sceptical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I&#8217;ve done telling you before you pull
faces, you old bluebottle! Can&#8217;t you trust me by
now to get up a decent rag? Yes, I&#8217;m offended!
All right, I&#8217;ll accept apologies. Now if you&#8217;re
really listening, I&#8217;ll explain. You know the gipsies
are camping down by the river. Everybody in
the school has noticed their caravans, and realizes
they&#8217;re there. Now what&#8217;s more natural than for
a couple of these gipsies to stroll round by the barn
some evening during recreation time, and offer to
predict the future? Katherine and Ave could be
in the secret, have their fortunes told first, and then
bring others. We&#8217;d install ourselves in the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
cow-house; it&#8217;s so dark, no one would see us very
plainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ray, you&#8217;ve enough imagination for a novelist!&#8221;
murmured Ardiune admiringly.</p>
<p>Having settled their plan of campaign, the next
step was to carry out details. The question of
costume loomed largest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must look real gipsies, not stage ones,&#8221;
decreed Raymonde. &#8220;The thing&#8217;s got to be done
properly, if it&#8217;s done at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>They ransacked the property box used for school
theatricals, and having selected some likely garments,
set to work on an ideal of realism. Two
skirts were carefully torn on nails, artistically
stained with rust and mud, and rubbed on the
barn floor to give them an extra tone. Some cotton
bodices were similarly treated. Shoes were a knotty
problem, for gipsies do not generally affect trim
footgear, yet nobody at the Grange possessed
worn-out or dilapidated boots. In the end Raymonde
carefully unpicked the stitches in her oldest
pairs to give them the requisite burst appearance,
and with the aid of a file rubbed the respectability
from them. A dip in the mud of the moat completed
the transformation. Some cheap beads and
coloured handkerchiefs, and a faint wash of Vandyke
brown over face and hands, gave the finishing
touches.</p>
<p>In the interval between preparation and supper,
when several members of the Sixth Form were pursuing
carpentry and other industrial occupations
in the barn, Aveline Kerby entered to borrow a
screw-driver. She conversed casually on the topics
of wood-carving, photography, pressed flowers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
and kindred hobbies; then, just as she was leaving,
turned back and remarked, apparently as an afterthought:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, by the by, do you know there are two
gipsies in the cow-house? They&#8217;re from the caravan
by the river. They came in through the back gate,
begging, and Morvyth happened to meet them.
They offered to tell her fortune, so she took them
into the cow-house, so that Gibbie shouldn&#8217;t see
them. She says they&#8217;re marvellous. They described
her mother exactly, and her brother at the
front. Isn&#8217;t it wonderful now they can do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they there still?&#8221; asked Veronica, swallowing
the bait.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe so. At least they were, five minutes
ago. Elsie Moseley and Cynthia Greene had gone
to see them. I&#8217;d go myself, but I&#8217;ve spent all my
allowance, and of course one has to cross their
palms with the orthodox piece of silver, I suppose.
It&#8217;s hard luck to be stony-broke. Ta-ta! Thanks
for the screw-driver!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aveline beat a judicious retreat, and left her
words to work. As she had expected, the news
of the arrival of the occultists was received with
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an extraordinary thing that gipsies are so
often gifted with psychic powers,&#8221; commented Meta.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re children of nature,&#8221; returned Veronica.
&#8220;I suppose our ultra-civilization blunts our astral
perceptions. One finds marvellous things among
the hill tribes in India&mdash;things that can&#8217;t be explained
by any known rules of science.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose these ancient races have inherited
secrets that we can&#8217;t grasp?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they follow forgotten laws of nature.
Some day, no doubt, science will rediscover them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Veronica spoke seriously. During the holidays
she had studied the subject by the aid of books
borrowed from the Free Library.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like just to go and have a look at these
gipsies,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Will you come with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She voiced the feelings of the others. They rose
with one accord, and went in the direction of the
cow-shed. They met Cynthia Greene and Elsie
Moseley coming out, half-awed, half-giggling. At
the sight of monitresses they dived round the corner
of the building, and escaped into the orchard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly our duty to investigate,&#8221; propounded
Meta.</p>
<p>It is pleasant when duty and inclination coincide.
The girls walked forward briskly. The interior of
the cow-house was dark as an Eastern temple. The
gipsies had established themselves in the dimmest
corner, and were squatting on bundles of straw
under a manger. Obviously they were extremely
dirty and dilapidated. Their hands and faces appeared
to be unacquainted with soap and water,
their clothes were tattered, their shoes seemingly
in the last stage of decrepitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell your fortunes, my pretty ladies?&#8221; pattered
one of the Romanys. Her voice was hoarse but
conciliatory. Possibly she had a cold&mdash;tents are
notoriously draughty sleeping-places.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t care about vulgar fortunes, we are
really interested,&#8221; commenced Veronica. &#8220;What
we&#8217;d like to know is how you get your powers.
Where does your knowledge of the future come
from? I&#8217;ve always wanted to ask this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>The gipsy woman shook her head pityingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, lady! We don&#8217;t know ourselves! It comes
to us suddenly. Like a flash of light we see your
future&mdash;then it fades. It&#8217;s a sixth sense that&#8217;s given
to the poor gipsies. They&#8217;re born with it, and they
can&#8217;t explain it any more than you can explain the
breath of your body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often heard of this sixth sense,&#8221; whispered
Daphne to Lois.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes we feel what&#8217;s going to be, and
sometimes we see it,&#8221; continued the gipsy, fumbling
with something in her lap. &#8220;We can&#8217;t tell beforehand
which way the knowledge will come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you&#8217;ve got there?&#8221; asked Veronica
sharply. &#8220;Is it a crystal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, lady. It is a crystal, and a
wonderful one too. My grandmother got it from&mdash;but
no! I&#8217;d best not be telling that. I wouldn&#8217;t
part with it, lady, if the Queen offered me her
crown in exchange. Take it in your hand! Look
how it sparkles! It doesn&#8217;t often shine like that&mdash;only
when someone with the sixth sense holds it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve sometimes suspected that I possess psychic
powers!&#8221; murmured Veronica complacently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to learn the future, lady?&#8221;
queried the gipsy. &#8220;Then hold it so, in your
hands, for a minute. Now it has felt you and
known you, and it will tell&mdash;oh, yes! it will tell!&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the crystal again, and turned to the
companion who squatted beside her on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zara! Look what is coming to the lady,&#8221; she
commanded softly.</p>
<p>Zara, who had apparently been in a deep reverie,
roused herself with a start, placed the crystal in her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
lap with the first finger and the thumb of each hand
lightly touching it, and stared fixedly into the magic
glass. For a moment or two the future seemed
obscured, then evidently it cleared. She began to
speak in a deep, monotonous voice, as if talking
in her sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see the sea&mdash;waves&mdash;waves&mdash;everywhere.
There is a ship&mdash;oh! it has changed. I see sand,
and a white house, and palm trees. A soldier in
khaki is coming out of the house. He stops to
speak to a servant&mdash;a black man in a turban&mdash;he
is angry&mdash;he frowns&mdash;he goes again into the white
house. Oh, it is fading&mdash;it is gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother Leslie&#8217;s in Egypt!&#8221; gasped
Veronica, much impressed.</p>
<p>She would have requested a continuance of the
vision, but at that moment the dressing-bell clanged
loudly. It was plainly time to go and tidy up for
supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you could come again to-morrow about five,&#8221;
she suggested, pressing a coin into the gipsy&#8217;s
ready hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, lady, if we&#8217;re still in the neighbourhood.
We never know when we&#8217;ll be moving on, you see.
But we&#8217;ll try to oblige you if we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde&#8217;s and Ardiune&#8217;s toilets that evening
would have done credit to quick-change variety
artistes. With clean faces and hands, and their
dresses at least half fastened, they slipped into their
places at the supper-table just in time; a little
flurried, perhaps, but preserving an outward calm.
So far their scheme had succeeded admirably.
The Sixth appeared to have no suspicions.</p>
<p>They repeated their performance on the following
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
day, installing themselves in the cow-house, and
receiving relays of enquirers who came to consult
them as to their future. Knowing somewhat of the
private history of each member of the school, they
got on excellently, and their reputation spread till
more than half the girls had paid surreptitious
visits to their retreat. All might have gone well,
and their secret might have remained undiscovered,
had it not been for Veronica&#8217;s friendship with
Mademoiselle. Veronica was so impressed with
the value of the crystal&#8217;s information that she could
not help confiding the news, and bringing the impressionable
Belgian to consult the seer for herself.</p>
<p>Ardiune&#8217;s visions of smoking ruins and rescued
refugees left Mademoiselle almost speechless. She
in her turn felt impelled to seek a confidante, and
imparted the wonderful revelations to Miss Gibbs.</p>
<p>That worthy lady immediately set off for the cow-house.
As she entered there was a scuttling of
juniors, who sought safety behind the partition.
Raymonde stared for a moment aghast, then whispered
to Ardiune: &#8220;Bluff it out!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs proceeded in an absolutely business-like
manner. She requested a consultation, and
listened while the gipsy, decidedly nervous, gave
a rambling description of a dark gentleman and an
Indian temple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;I think it only
fair to warn you that you can be prosecuted and
fined twenty-five pounds for telling fortunes. I
should like to know where you got that crystal!
It&#8217;s remarkably like the ball of glass that was
broken off my Venetian vase. I missed it yesterday
from my mantelpiece. By the by&#8221;&mdash;stooping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
down suddenly, and pulling aside the handkerchief
from Zara&#8217;s swarthy neck&mdash;&#8220;you are wearing a
locket and chain that I know to be the property of
one of my pupils. It is my duty immediately to
put you in the hands of the police.&#8221;</p>
<p>The game was up! The disconcerted gipsies
rose from their alcove, and came back from the
psychic to the material world. It was a hard,
exacting, unsympathetic world as mirrored in Miss
Gibbs&#8217;s keen grey eyes. She told them briefly to
go and wash their faces and change their attire,
then to report themselves in the class-room, where
she would be at work correcting exercises.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bring with you the money that you
have collected over this business,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, two clean, tidy, but dejected
pupils entered the class-room, and placed the sum
of thirteen and ninepence upon her desk. Miss
Gibbs counted it over scrupulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any girls who were foolish enough to give you
this, deserve to lose it,&#8221; she remarked, &#8220;and I shall
send it as a contribution to the Red Cross Fund.
You will each learn two pages of Curtis&#8217;s <i>Historical
Notes</i> by heart, and repeat them to me to-morrow
after morning school. I may mention that I consider
it a great liberty for any girl to enter my
bedroom and remove ornaments from my mantelpiece.&#8221;</p>
<p>That evening, after preparation and supper, the
entire school, instead of being allowed to pursue
fancy work, was summoned to the lecture hall, and
harangued by Miss Beasley upon the follies and
dangers of superstition. She touched upon ancient
beliefs in witchcraft, and modern credulity in clairvoyance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
and spiritualism, and placed an equal ban
upon both.</p>
<p>&#8220;In these enlightened times, with all the advantages
of education to dispel ignorance,&#8221; she
concluded, &#8220;it is incredible to me that anybody
can still be found ready to believe in such nonsense.
I beg you all, and especially those elder girls who
should be leaders of the rest, to turn your thoughts
and conversation to some healthier topic, and to let
these morbid fancies sink into the obscurity they
deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a nasty hit for the monitresses!&#8221; whispered
Ardiune to Raymonde afterwards. &#8220;Did
you see Veronica turning as red as beetroot? We&#8217;ll
have to wake early to-morrow morning, and swat
at those wretched dates. It was grizzly bad luck
Gibbie found us out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But on the whole the game was worth the
candle!&#8221; proclaimed Raymonde unrepentantly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>The Beano</h3>
</div>
<p>After the events related in the last chapter, the
monitresses suddenly awakened to a sense of their
responsibility as leaders of the school. Particularly
Veronica. She had a sensitive disposition, and
Miss Beasley&#8217;s reproof rankled. She determined
to set an example to the younger ones, and to be
zealous in keeping order and enforcing rules. She
held a surprise inspection of the juniors&#8217; desks and
drawers, and pounced upon illicit packets of chocolate;
she examined their books, and confiscated any
which she considered unsuitable; she put a ban
upon slang, and wrote out a new set of dormitory
regulations. Her efforts were hardly so much appreciated
as they deserved. The girls grumbled at
this unanticipated tightening of the reins.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always bought sweets and kept them
in our desks,&#8221; declared Joan Butler. &#8220;I believe
Veronica used to do it herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life wouldn&#8217;t be worth living without chocolates!&#8221;
mourned Nora Fawcitt.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we always used to scramble for the bathroom
in the mornings, ever since I&#8217;ve been here,&#8221;
groused Dorothy Newstead. &#8220;It&#8217;s no fun to wait
in a queue.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>The Fifth fared no better than the Fourth, and
being older, their indignation was even hotter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Veronica took away <i>Adam Bede</i>, and said it
wasn&#8217;t &#8216;suitable&#8217;!&#8221; fumed Aveline. &#8220;She told me
I might read Scott and Dickens instead. And I&#8217;d
just got to the interesting part! It&#8217;s too idiotic!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see why Veronica need act censor to all
our reading,&#8221; agreed Katherine bitterly. &#8220;Why
should we be allowed Jane Austen and not Charlotte
Bront&euml;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Little girls mustn&#8217;t read love stories!&#8221; mocked
Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re all love stories&mdash;Scott&#8217;s and Dickens&#8217;s
and Jane Austen&#8217;s and everyone&#8217;s! How about
Shakespeare? There&#8217;s heaps of love-making in
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and we took that with Professor
Marshall!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Gibbie ever quite approved of it.
She thought it indiscreet of the Professor, I&#8217;m sure,
and likely to put ideas into our heads!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does she expect we&#8217;ll go eloping over the
garden wall? Perhaps that&#8217;s why she keeps such
a vigilant look-out with the telescope!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite bad enough to have Gibbie always
on our trail,&#8221; said Ardiune gloomily, &#8220;but when
it comes to Veronica turning watch-dog as well,
I call it an outrage!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Fifth-Form girls have responsibilities
as well as monitresses,&#8221; grunted Raymonde. &#8220;It&#8217;s
not good for Veronica to take life so earnestly!
She&#8217;ll grow old before her time. The Bumble&#8217;s
always rubbing it into us to make the most of
our girlhood, and not be little premature women,
so I vote we live up to her theory. It&#8217;s Veronica&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
last term here. She ought to be bubbling and
girlish, and carry away happy memories of her
light-hearted school-days when she goes out into
the wide world to be a woman. I consider it&#8217;s our
duty to look after this. The Bumble says the value
of school life consists in its &#8216;give and take&#8217;. We&#8217;re
taking a good deal from Veronica at present, so we
must give her something back. Let&#8217;s teach her to
be kittenish and playful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chums exploded. The idea of the serious-minded
Veronica developing a bubbling or kittenish
manner was too much for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did pretty well when we took Maudie
Heywood in hand,&#8221; urged Raymonde. &#8220;She&#8217;s
wonderfully improved. Never exceeds the speed
limit in her lessons, and if she writes extra essays
she keeps them to herself, and doesn&#8217;t flaunt them
before the Form. And there was Cynthia Greene,
too! We don&#8217;t hear a word about The Poplars
now, or her wretched bracelet. It may be difficult,
perhaps, but we&#8217;ll do our best with Veronica. We
must regard ourselves as sort of missionaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having decided that it was their vocation to
cultivate a spirit of artless happiness in the school,
the Mystic Seven set to work on Veronica. She
did not respond to their efforts; on the contrary,
she seemed to resent them. When they attempted
to introduce lighter veins of conversation, she reproached
them with being frivolous. She frowned
on riddles, limericks, and puns. One day she so
far forgot herself as to murmur &#8220;Cheeky kids!&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde, with a shocked and grieved expression,
looked at the illuminated card deprecating the
use of slang, which had lately been hung in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
lecture hall, and Veronica flounced out of the
room.</p>
<p>That night, when the monitress went to bed, her
sponge, nail-brush, tooth-brush, and cake of soap
were missing, and it was only after a long search
that she found them at the bottom of her emptied
water-jug. On the next evening it was impossible
for her to strike a light, owing to the fact that both
her candle and matches had been carefully soaked
beforehand in water.</p>
<p>Veronica felt it was high time to lay the matter
before her fellow-monitresses. They decided that
such flagrant cases of insubordination must be
promptly dealt with. In order to catch the offenders
they laid a trap, Linda and Daphne concealing
themselves in Veronica&#8217;s bedroom, while Veronica
herself walked ostentatiously in the courtyard.</p>
<p>As they had expected, it was not long before two
stealthy figures came tiptoeing in, and were taken
red-handed in the very act of constructing an
apple-pie bed. The vials of wrath which descended
upon the would-be practical jokers were enough to
damp the spirits of even such madcaps as Raymonde
and Aveline. After all, monitresses are
monitresses, and to affront them is rather like twisting
a lion&#8217;s tail. Miss Gibbs herself could not
have been more scathing in her sarcasms than
Linda. For once the Mystics retired crushed, and
with a due respect for their seniors.</p>
<p>It was not in the nature of things, however, for
Raymonde&#8217;s spirits to remain long below zero.
After a decent period of immersion they once more
rose to the surface. The occasion of their revival
was sufficient to awaken enthusiasm in the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
down-trodden and monitress-ridden of school-girls.</p>
<p>A report was rumoured through the Grange;
nobody seemed to know quite where it started, or
what was the fount of information, but everybody
said it was perfectly true, and girl whispered to
girl the astounding secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bumble and the Wasp are going out to
dinner on Thursday, and are to stay the night,
only we&#8217;re not supposed to get a hint of it, so don&#8217;t
breathe a word, or let on you&#8217;ve heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Circumstantial evidence seemed to confirm the
statement. Emily, the sewing-maid, had been
seen in the linen-room employed on some renovations
to Miss Beasley&#8217;s best evening dress; Miss
Gibbs&#8217;s suit-case had been brought down from the
box-room to have its lock and handles polished;
and Dorothy Newstead, concealed behind a laurel
bush during a game of &#8220;Hide-and-seek,&#8221; had overheard
the Principal give instructions to the gardener
to order a conveyance for Thursday evening at half-past
six. Certainly nothing could be more conclusive.
Excitement was rife. Never in all the
annals of the school had Miss Beasley and Miss
Gibbs together taken a night off!</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a shame to waste such a golden opportunity!&#8221;
said Raymonde enthusiastically. &#8220;Gibbie
was talking to us only to-day about seizing our
opportunities.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>
<p>She quoted it most impressively.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t go on to the verse about getting
married while you&#8217;d the chance, though!&#8221; chuckled
Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my child. Such a subject as matrimony
is not supposed to be a fitting topic for a ladies&#8217;
school. Gibbie always gracefully shelves it. But
you&#8217;re side-tracking, and I want to get back to my
point. I was talking of opportunities, and never
in the whole of our school-days shall we get such
another as next Thursday. How are we going
to make use of it? I vote for a beano in our
dormitory.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a &#8216;beano&#8217;?&#8221; demanded Fauvette&#8217;s plaintive
voice. &#8220;You&#8217;re always saying things I don&#8217;t
understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re young, child!&#8221; returned Raymonde indulgently,
&#8220;and you can&#8217;t be expected to know
everything. A beano is a bean-feast. Now don&#8217;t
look alarmed! We&#8217;re not going to eat beans; we&#8217;ll
have something far more appetizing&mdash;sardines, and
tinned peaches, and biscuits, and anything else we
can get. If the Bumble and the Wasp gad off to
enjoy themselves, why shouldn&#8217;t we make a night
of it too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about those kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll join in. It shall be an affair for the
whole dormitory. We&#8217;ll share the treat, for once!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t get the monitresses to join,&#8221; interposed
Katherine dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t ask them! I&#8217;ve settled all that in my
mind. You know the big oak door across the passage
that leads to their rooms? Well, I&#8217;m going
to fasten it after they&#8217;ve gone to bed, and lock them
up in their own quarters.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That would be all right, old sport, if there were
a key, but there isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morvyth Holmes, d&#8217;you think I&#8217;m an infant?
I know perfectly well there isn&#8217;t a key. I&#8217;m going
to fix a screw in the door and another in the doorpost
beforehand, and then twist some strong wire
across. It&#8217;ll act like a lock.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mystics stared at their leader in admiration.
Her resourcefulness knew no bounds. With the
monitresses safely boxed up in their bedrooms, any
jinks would be possible in the dormitory. Of
course there remained Mademoiselle, but she slept
at the other side of the house, and from past experience
they judged that she was more likely to devote
the evening to her own pleasure than to an over-strict
attention to duty. The juniors, when sounded
on the subject, responded to a girl. Even Cynthia
Greene assented gleefully. Every occupant of the
dormitory vowed with a solemn oath to preserve
the secret at all costs. A fund was opened to
defray expenses. How to get the provisions was
the main difficulty. There was not a single servant
in the establishment whom they felt was absolutely
to be trusted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe even that new little Lizzie would go
and sneak to the Bumble,&#8221; sighed Raymonde.
&#8220;We shall have to go for the things ourselves.
There&#8217;s nothing else for it. Who&#8217;ll volunteer?
Oh! not all of you! We can&#8217;t trot off in a body.
Look here, I&#8217;ll go with Morvyth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The village, which lay half a mile away from the
Grange, was out of bounds. It would be an extremely
risky proceeding for two girls, in the
ordinary brown serge uniform and conspicuous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
hats of the school, to enter a shop and make purchases.
Some tiresome busybody would be sure
to see them, and report the matter to Miss Beasley.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case of disguising ourselves,&#8221; decided
Raymonde. &#8220;The maids keep their waterproofs
and hats in the passage near the kitchen. We&#8217;ll
turn up our hair, borrow what garments we want,
and dash off between prep. and supper. Anyone
noticing us on the road will think we&#8217;re new servants
from some house in the neighbourhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The audacity of the project almost staggered
Morvyth, but as a member of the Mystic Seven
she was pledged to follow her leader, and would
not for worlds have displayed symptoms of the
white feather, though her more cautious soul began
to calculate consequences if caught. There were
so many pitfalls in the path&mdash;servants, monitresses,
and mistresses must be outwitted, both in going
and returning, to make their excursion a success.
The juniors, however, played up nobly. At a concerted
hour, they managed by cleverly concocted
excuses to engage the attention of all the monitresses,
and hold them busy for five minutes explaining
details of lessons or fancy work. Meantime,
Aveline and Valentine purloined waterproofs
of a suitable length, together with appropriate hats,
from the passage near the kitchen.</p>
<p>Raymonde and Morvyth, after a rapid toilet and
a hasty review of themselves in a looking-glass,
were pleased with their appearance, especially the
way they wore their hats.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tilt yours a little more on one side,&#8221; commanded
Raymonde, &#8220;and open your mouth with
a sort of cod-fishy expression, as if you&#8217;d got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
adenoids. Remember, you want to look as common
as possible. Drop your h&#8217;s when you speak,
wherever you can. Say you&#8217;re in a &#8217;urry to get
back. I shall sniff all the time, as if I&#8217;d a bad
cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall laugh if you do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t, because we&#8217;re going to different
shops. I&#8217;ll do Adcock&#8217;s, and you shall have Seymour&#8217;s.
It&#8217;ll be far better than going together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under cover of a guard of Form-mates the conspirators
managed to slip past the barns and off
the premises, secure in the knowledge that Miss
Gibbs was correcting exercises in the study, so
could not possibly be watching them through her
too useful telescope. Before arriving at the village
they separated, Raymonde going a little in advance,
and Morvyth following, as if they had no acquaintance
with each other. It was perhaps as well for
their mutual composure that they visited separate
shops, for Morvyth&#8217;s provincial accent and Raymonde&#8217;s
cold might have been mirth-provoking to
a fellow conspirator, though they passed muster
well enough with strangers. At the end of ten
minutes the two girls were hurrying back, each
armed with a large parcel. These were handed at
once to scouts when they reached the Grange, and
their costumes were removed in the barn, and replaced
without delay on their hooks in the kitchen
passage by Valentine and Ardiune.</p>
<p>So far so good. The commissariat department
had managed to run the blockade of school regulations,
and secure provisions for the entertainment.
No Tommies looting supplies from the enemy&#8217;s
trenches could have felt prouder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>When the eventful Thursday arrived, great
anxiety was felt as to whether the Principal and
her assistant were really and actually going out or
not. They did not announce their intention, and
gave no hint of the matter. Little Nancie Page,
however, sent to Miss Gibbs&#8217;s room with a message,
reported having seen that lady engaged in packing
her suit-case, which was taken as proof conclusive
of the contemplated expedition.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be subdued saints all supper-time!&#8221; suggested
Raymonde. &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk intelligently to the
monitresses about intellectual subjects&mdash;the deeper
the better. Make them think we&#8217;re going to bed
with our minds fixed on Egyptology, and the
wonders of the microscope, and the Bagdad railway,
and the future of European politics. Be sure you
go upstairs very quietly. Anyone who laughs will
give the show away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The behaviour of the school that evening was a
subject of satisfaction to Veronica and her fellow
monitresses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid,&#8221; remarked the head girl, &#8220;that
they might take advantage when they saw Miss
Beasley&#8217;s and Miss Gibbs&#8217;s places empty at supper,
but they seemed to feel on their honour to be
steadier than usual. I really think their tone is
improving. Raymonde Armitage was particularly
quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; returned Daphne dubiously. &#8220;So she
was; but if Raymonde has a quiet fit like that on,
I generally look out for squalls afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Mademoiselle went the round of the dormitory
that night at 9.30, she found absolute peace
and tranquillity reigning. Apparently the occupants
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
of the nineteen beds were already wrapt in
well-earned repose. One or two were even snoring
slightly. Mademoiselle heaved a sigh of relief, and
went off thankfully to her own bedroom to write
letters. She did not consider it necessary to interrupt
herself at this occupation. Miss Gibbs had
indeed urged the expediency of a surprise visit at
about 10 p.m., but Mademoiselle had no vocation
for enforcing discipline, and was not over-burdened
with conscientious scruples. Moreover, she considered
that, if her Principal took an evening off,
she might be licensed to do the same.</p>
<p>The conspirators had decided not to begin the
celebrations too early. With heroic self-restraint
they remained quietly in bed until 10.30. By that
hour monitresses and servants alike would probably
be asleep. Mademoiselle, at the far end of the
house, on the other side of the big staircase, would
hear nothing.</p>
<p>When the charmed moment arrived, everybody
sprang up and lighted candles. Raymonde hurried
into pink dressing-gown and bedroom slippers, and
crept up the passage to the door which led to the
monitresses&#8217; rooms. She had inserted her screws
earlier in the evening, so with the aid of a pair of
pliers, purloined from the wood-carving bench, it
did not take her long to fix her wire and secure the
door. She came back chuckling.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they should hear any slight sounds of revelry,
and try to come upon the scenes, they&#8217;ll just find
themselves jolly well locked in!&#8221; she remarked with
gusto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;ll think Mademoiselle&#8217;s done it!&#8221;
suggested Ardiune.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>Preparations for the feast were proceeding briskly.
Two beds, pulled into the middle of the room, formed
the table, and on these the comestibles were spread
forth. The village shops had not offered a very
wide range of dainties, but there were sardines, and
canned peaches, and biscuits, and three Huntley &amp;
Palmer&#8217;s cakes, rather dry, because they had been
kept in a tin box, probably since last Christmas.
The drinkable was lemon kali, served in bedroom
tumblers, and stirred up with lead-pencils or tooth-brush
handles.</p>
<p>Everybody was busy. Morvyth and Valentine
were opening the tins with wood-carving implements;
Ardiune was performing an abstruse arithmetical
calculation as to how to cut up three cakes
into nineteen exactly even portions, while Katherine
waited with the penknife ready. Even the hitherto
irreproachable Maudie Heywood and Cynthia
Greene were occupied with scissors, making plates
out of sheets of exercise paper. Beds drawn up
alongside the impromptu table served for seats, and
the girls crowded together as closely as they could.
Raymonde and Morvyth, by virtue of their expedition
to the shops, were voted mistresses of the
ceremonies, and dispensed the provisions. Sardines
on biscuits were the first course, followed by
canned peaches, the juiciness of which was a decided
difficulty, as there was not a solitary spoon
with which to fish them up from the tin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, I&#8217;ll spear them with a lead-pencil
and stick them on biscuits, and you must drink the
syrup in the glasses. I dare say it&#8217;ll mix all right
with lemon kali,&#8221; purred Raymonde, thoroughly in
her element as hostess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>The fun waxed furious, and it only increased
when the sardine tin upset in the middle of one of
the temporary tables.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s my bed!&#8221; wailed Cynthia Greene.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheer up! Someone&#8217;s got to make a sacrifice
for the good of the assembly, and you see the
lot&#8217;s fallen on you,&#8221; said Raymonde consolingly.
&#8220;You ought to be proud to have your bed
chosen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d just as soon it had been yours!&#8221; grumbled
Cynthia. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t like sleeping in a puddle of
oil!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you grouse any more, I&#8217;ll empty the can of
peaches on your pillow, so shut up!&#8221; commanded
the mistress of the ceremonies. &#8220;A beano&#8217;s a
beano, and we&#8217;re going to enjoy ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we make too much noise, though&#8211;&#8211;&#8221; suggested
Maudie Heywood.</p>
<p>Ardiune snapped her up promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make what noise we like! What does
it matter? The monitresses are locked out, and
Mademoiselle will never hear. We&#8217;ve got the
place to ourselves to-night, thank goodness! Just
for once, Mother Soup&#8217;s room down there is
vacant!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Empty is the cradle, baby&#8217;s gone!&#8221; mocked
Morvyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Xpect she&#8217;s having the time of her life at the
dinner-party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have ours!&#8221;</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later the dormitory presented
a convivial scene. An orchestra of five,
seated on a hastily cleared dressing-table, were
performing music with combs, while the rest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
company waltzed between the beds, with intervals
of the fox-trot. Maudie Heywood and Cynthia
Greene had accepted the inevitable, and joined the
multitude. Apparently they were enjoying themselves.
Maudie&#8217;s cheeks were scarlet, and Cynthia&#8217;s
long fair hair floated out picturesquely as she
twirled round in Elsie Moseley&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re certainly making the most of our bubbling
girlhood!&#8221; murmured Raymonde with satisfaction.
&#8220;The Bumble couldn&#8217;t call us little
premature women to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dark anti-zepp curtains swayed in the
night breeze, and the candles flared and guttered,
the musicians tootled at their tissue-paper covered
combs with tingling lips, faster and faster whirled
the dancers, the fun was at its zenith, when quite
suddenly the unexpected happened. The door of
Miss Gibbs&#8217;s room opened, and that grim lady
herself stood on the threshold.</p>
<p>If a spectre had made its appearance in their
midst, the girls could not have been more disconcerted.
A horrible hush spread over the room, and
for a moment everybody stared in frozen horror.
The musicians slipped down from the dressing-table
and scuttled towards their own beds.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! So this is how you are to be trusted!&#8221;
remarked Miss Gibbs tartly, advancing towards the
scene of the beano, and hastily casting an eye over
the empty tins and crumby remains of the repast.
&#8220;Move this rubbish away, and push those beds
back to their places. Now get into bed, every
one of you! Not a single sound more is to be
heard to-night. We&#8217;ll settle up this matter to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>Having seen each occupant of the dormitory
ensconced between her sheets (Cynthia did not dare
to complain that hers were sardiny!) Miss Gibbs
went back to her own room, leaving the door wide
open. With an enraged dragon in such close
vicinity the girls did not venture to stir, and silence
reigned for the rest of the night. At the first
coming of the dawn, however, Raymonde rose
with infinite precaution, and stole barefoot along
the passage to remove her wire and screws from
the oak door. She accomplished that task without
discovery, and, after hiding the screw-driver behind
a wardrobe, crept back to bed.</p>
<p>Nineteen subdued penitents, clothed in mental
sackcloth and ashes, went down to breakfast next
morning. Their fears were not without foundation,
for when Miss Beasley returned at ten o&#8217;clock they
were summoned to the most unpleasant interview
they ever remembered, from which the more soft-hearted
of them emerged sobbing. They spent
Saturday afternoon in the schoolroom writing
punishment tasks, while the monitresses went boating
on the river. It was trying to see Daphne and
Hermie coming downstairs in their nice white
dresses and blue ties, and to know that they themselves
were debarred the excursion. They hung
about the hall sulkily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your own faults,&#8221; moralized Veronica.
&#8220;After that disgraceful business on Thursday, you
couldn&#8217;t expect anything else. We heard you
plainly enough, and we were utterly disgusted.
I&#8217;d like to know who locked that passage door. I
have my suspicions,&#8221; with an eye on Raymonde.</p>
<p>The babyish innocence of Raymonde&#8217;s face at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
that moment might have served an artist as a model
for a child angel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you? It&#8217;s a pity to harbour suspicion!&#8221;
she returned sweetly. &#8220;We ought to learn to trust
our schoolfellows! I loathe Veronica,&#8221; she added
in a whisper to Ardiune, as the monitress tripped
cheerily to the door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A Week on the Land</h3>
</div>
<p>The vacations at the Grange were arranged in
rather an unusual fashion, a full week&#8217;s holiday
being given at Whitsuntide instead of the ordinary
little break at half-term. This year Miss Gibbs,
who was nothing if not patriotic, evolved a plan
for the benefit of her country. She saw an advertisement
in the local newspaper, stating that volunteers
would soon be urgently needed to gather the
strawberry crop upon a farm about fifteen miles
away, and begging ladies of education to lend their
services. Such a splendid opportunity of war work
appealed to her. She wrote at once for particulars,
and after some correspondence and a visit to the
scene of action, announced her scheme to the school.
She proposed that any girls who cared to devote
their holidays to a useful end should join a camp
of strawberry-pickers who were to be employed on
the farm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is being arranged by a Government bureau,&#8221;
she explained, &#8220;and many people will be coming
who, like ourselves, want to help to bear their
country&#8217;s burdens&mdash;university students, journalists,
social workers, hospital nurses, matrons of institutions,
and mistresses and scholars from other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
schools. We shall sleep in tents, and lead an
absolutely outdoor life. It will be a healthy way
of passing a week, as well as a benefit to the nation.
Any girl who would like to do her share may give
me her name this afternoon, and Miss Beasley
will write to her parents for permission for her to
join the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside in the quadrangle the school talked over
the proposition at its leisure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will they let us eat the strawberries?&#8221; asked
Fauvette anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, you little glutton!&#8221; snapped Veronica.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be allowed to stuff till you loathe the very
thought of swallowing a strawberry. But you&#8217;ll
have to pick hard and do your share, or they&#8217;ll
turn you off!&#8221;</p>
<p>The monitresses were fired with the idea, and
all, except Linda, had decided to &#8220;do their bit.&#8221;
Their enthusiasm spread downward like a wave.
Before the day was over, eighteen girls had given
in their names as volunteers, Raymonde, Morvyth,
Katherine, and Aveline being among the number.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to have joined you, really!&#8221; protested
Fauvette, &#8220;only I know I&#8217;ll be so dreadfully
home-sick all the rest of the term if I don&#8217;t go home,
and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t apologize, child!&#8221; interrupted Raymonde.
&#8220;Nobody in their senses expects you to go. You&#8217;d
be a huge embarrassment to the rest of us. Blue-eyed
darlings, all baby-ribbon and fluffy hair, aren&#8217;t
meant for hard work. Why, you&#8217;d pick about six
strawberries in an hour, and eat three-quarters of
them! Go home and be petted, by all means! We
don&#8217;t want you weeping yourself to sleep at night,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
it disturbs the dormitory. The country&#8217;ll survive
without your services!&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde&#8217;s harum-scarum mind was for once
really filled with a wish to help. She meant to do
her full share of work. Also she was determined
to enjoy herself. The prospect of camp-life was
alluring. There was a gipsy smack about it that
satisfied her unconventional instincts. It seemed
almost next door to campaigning.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d only been a boy, I&#8217;d have run away to
the front long ago!&#8221; she announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls have their own chances in life as well
as boys now,&#8221; said Hermie. &#8220;Wait till you&#8217;ve
finished with school, then you must try to find your
niche in the world. There&#8217;s plenty of pioneer work
for women to do yet. They haven&#8217;t half exploited
the colonies. Once we show we&#8217;re some good on
the land, why shouldn&#8217;t the Government start us in
co-operative farms out in New Zealand or Australia?
It ought to be done systematically. Everything&#8217;s
been so haphazard before. Imagine a farm all run
by girls educated at our best secondary and public
schools! It would be ideal. I&#8217;m yearning to try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hermie&#8217;s aspirations towards field labour and a
colonial future had been greatly spurred on lately
by the advent of some lady labourers on a farm
near the Grange. For the last fortnight the milk
had been delivered, not by the usual uncouth boy,
but by a charming member of the feminine sex,
attired in short smock, knickers and gaiters, and
a picturesque rush hat. Hermie had entered into
conversation with her, and learned that she was a
clergyman&#8217;s daughter, that she milked six cows
morning and evening, and went round with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
cart delivering the milk, and that she was further
concerned with the care of poultry, pigs, and calves.
The glamour of her experiences made Hermie wish
that the Grange were full of pigs instead of pupils.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather attend to a dozen nice little black
Berkshires than act monitress to those juniors!&#8221;
she sighed. &#8220;There would really be more satisfaction
in it. And as for Raymonde Armitage and
her set&mdash;give me young calves any day!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs was extremely busy making preparations
for the expedition. The farmer undertook to
provide tents for the party, and bags of hay to sleep
upon, but each member must bring her own pillow,
blankets, mug, knife, fork, spoon and plate, as well
as her personal belongings. These latter were
whittled down to the smallest capacity, for there
would be little room to stow them away in the
tents. Stout boots, waterproofs, and hockey caps
were taken, in case the weather might change, the
girls wearing their usual Panama school hats on
fine days. In order to prevent difficulty with the
ordinary strawberry-pickers, they were to be paid
for their work according to the amount accomplished,
and were each to contribute ten shillings
towards the canteen, the tents being provided free.</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose we don&#8217;t each earn ten shillings?&#8221;
asked Daphne the cautious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever doesn&#8217;t will have to make up the
balance from her own pocket,&#8221; said Miss Gibbs.
&#8220;If the ordinary pickers can pay their way, I
suppose we can do the same, but it will mean
sticking at it hard, and no shirking. We must
show what we&#8217;re made of!&#8221;</p>
<p>On the Friday before Whitsun week an excited
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
little party of eighteen stood with bags and bundles
ready to start, Miss Gibbs bustling round them like
a fussy hen with a large brood of chicks, giving
ever so many last directions and injunctions, which
seemed rather superfluous as she was going with
them, and would have them under her charge the
whole time. They went by rail to Ledcombe, the
nearest station to Shipley, where the strawberry
gardens were situated. The scene on the platform
when they arrived was certainly new and out of the
common. A train had just come in from London,
bringing pickers from the slums. It was labelled
&#8220;Strawberry Gatherers Only,&#8221; and its cargo was
lively, not to say noisy. There were elderly men,
younger ones unfit for military service, women
with bawling babies, girls shouting popular songs,
and a swarm of turbulent children. Whole families
had apparently set forth to spend a few weeks helping
at the fruit harvest, combining a holiday
in the country with profit to their pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going among that crew, I hope?&#8221;
said Daphne, staring rather aghast at the unkempt
crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not; we shall have our own quarters,&#8221;
returned Miss Gibbs, marshalling her flock to the
gate of exit. Drawn up outside the station were
six large hay wagons, and on one of these hung a
placard: &#8220;Marlowe Grange.&#8221; Miss Gibbs made
for it immediately, turning out some struggling
slum children who had already climbed in and
taken temporary possession, and stowed the baggage
inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of room for us all,&#8221; she announced,
&#8220;but you&#8217;ll each have to sit on your own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
bundle. I&#8217;m glad I stipulated that they should
reserve us a wagon for ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judging by the rabble who were swarming on to
the other hay carts, the girls also considered it a
cause for rejoicing. Their own vehicle started first,
and began to jolt slowly down the country road, its
occupants sitting as steadily as they could on their
knobbly luggage, and indulging in decidedly feminine
squeals when, as often happened, an extra
hard jog threw them together. After four miles of
this rather exciting journey they reached the farm.
Their driver stopped at a gate, and, pointing across
a field to some tents, indicated that this was their
destination. He could take them no nearer, and
they must convey their own bags and bundles over
the pasture.</p>
<p>Hauling their own luggage with them was no
light task, and they were heartily tired of their
burdens before they reached the tents. Three of
these, labelled Marlowe Grange, they appropriated;
then Miss Gibbs, after a brief confabulation with the
canteen matron, beckoned to her flock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear we must go at once and secure first pick
of the hay sacks,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Come along, all of
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Over three more fields and two stiles they came
to the farm buildings, where, spread out on hurdles,
were a number of large sacks, mercifully clean.
An individual in charge, wearing a faded blue suit
and a two days&#8217; growth of stubbly beard, told them
briefly to help themselves, and then take their sacks
to the barn and fill them with hay. Preparing
their own mattresses was a new experience, but an
amusing one. It was fun stuffing the sweet-smelling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
hay into the rough canvas bags, and more fun
still carrying the bulky bedding back over fields
and stiles to the tents. Here, amid a chaos of unpacking,
they at last disposed their belongings to
their satisfaction.</p>
<p>Their special little colony consisted of nine tents
and a marquee for meals. It was in charge of a
matron, who directed the canteen, and was responsible
for the comfort and order of the camp.
In each tent hung a list of rules respecting hours
of rising and going to bed, meals, and general
conduct. As there was no servant except the cook,
the task of washing up must be shared by all in
rotation, the matron having authority to apportion
the work. No lights or talking were to be allowed
after 10.30 p.m.</p>
<p>By the time the girls had settled all their possessions
it was seven o&#8217;clock, and the rest of the
camp returned from the strawberry fields. Supper
was served in the marquee, everybody sitting on
benches round wooden tables without cloths. The
company proved pleasant and congenial; there
were fifty in all, including some students from
Ludminster University, and eight girls and two
teachers from a secondary school at Tadbury. The
slum party, it seemed, were lodged in the big barns
behind the farm, while some caravans of gipsy
pickers had possession of a corner of a field some
distance away.</p>
<p>Supper finished, most of the workers sat about
and rested. A few, possessed of superfluous energy,
took a walk to the village a mile off, but the
generality were very tired. A gramophone in the
marquee blared away at popular songs, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
more lively spirits joined in the choruses; one or
two even attempted to dance on the grass. Miss
Gibbs had already struck up a friendship with a
lady journalist, and some of the girls began to
make overtures to the Tadbury scholars, who
looked rather a jolly little set. Everybody retired
early, as they would have to be up at 5.30, and in
the fields by seven.</p>
<p>The Marlowe Grange contingent were much
exercised as to the best way to place their mattresses.
They did not know whether to sleep with
their heads or their feet to the tent-pole, and finally
decided in favour of the former. Going to bed was
a funny business in so very small a space, with no
chairs or places to put clothes down, and only one
tin basin amongst six to wash in. It was funnier
still when they attempted to lie down on their mattresses.
A bag stuffed with hay is so round that it
is very difficult to keep upon it without rolling off,
and there was much pommelling and flattening
before the beds were at all tenable. At last everyone
was settled, the lights were out, and the
campers, rolled in their blankets, tried to compose
themselves to sleep.</p>
<p>Raymonde, whose billet was opposite the door
of the tent, could see out, and watch the stars shining.
She lay awake a long time, with her eyes
fixed on a bright planet that moved across the
little horizon of sky visible to her, till it passed out
of sight, and at length she too slept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>The Campers</h3>
</div>
<p>Life began at the camp soon after 5 a.m., when
the more energetic spirits tumbled off their hay
sacks, flung on dressing-gowns, and scrambled for
turns at the bath tent. Fetching water for the day
was the first business of the morning, and those on
bucket duty trotted off to the stream, two fields
away, joking and making fun as they went, but
returning more soberly with the heavy pails. The
6.15 breakfast tasted delicious after their early
outing, and most of the workers seemed in good
spirits. By seven o&#8217;clock the whole party were
down in the gardens. The Marlowe Grange girls
had never seen strawberries by the acre before, and
they were amazed, almost daunted, at the sight
of the vast quantity of fruit that must be gathered.
They were told off to a certain portion of the field,
given baskets, and shown where to bring them
when full. Each novice, for the first day, was
expected to work near an experienced hand, who
could show her what was required, as the picking,
though quick, must be careful, so as not to bruise
the strawberries. Raymonde and Morvyth found
themselves under the wing of a Social Settlement
secretary, a business-like dame who had picked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
the previous summer, and understood the swiftest
methods. Close by, they could hear Miss Gibbs
being instructed by the lady journalist, with whom
she had apparently cemented a friendship.</p>
<p>It was a point of honour to fill the baskets with
the utmost possible speed, and everybody worked
steadily. There was no rule against eating the
fruit, but the pay was according to the number of
baskets handed in, so that shirkers would find themselves
unable to earn their keep. It was a rather
back-breaking employment, but otherwise pleasant,
for the day was fine, the larks were singing, and
wild roses and honeysuckle bloomed in the hedgerows.
The slum pickers at the other side of the
field toiled away with practised fingers. Many of
them came every year, and would return in September
for the hop harvest. The small children played
under the hedge and took charge of the babies,
who cried and slept alternately, poor little souls!
without receiving much attention from the hardworking
mothers.</p>
<p>The slum contingent was a subject of much
amusement and curiosity to the Marlowe Grange
platoon. Though they occupied different portions
of the field, they would meet when they went to
deliver baskets. The rollicking good nature and
repartees of some of these people, especially of the
gipsies, were often very funny. They would chaff
the agent who registered their scores, with a considerable
power of humour, and the Grange girls,
waiting in line for their turns, would chuckle as
they overheard the conversations.</p>
<p>At eleven everybody ate lunch which they had
brought with them, then worked till one, when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
returned to the camp for dinner. Picking went on
again from two till six, with an interval at four
o&#8217;clock for tea, which was brought down to the
gardens in large cans, and poured into the workers&#8217;
own mugs. It was almost the most acceptable meal
of the day, taken sitting under the hedge, with the
scent of roses in the air, and the summer sunshine
falling across the fields.</p>
<p>By the end of the first evening, the Grange girls
decided that, though they wished they had cast-iron
backs, the experience on the whole was great
fun. They liked the camp life, and even their hay-sack
beds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vote we don&#8217;t sleep with our heads to the tent-pole
to-night, though,&#8221; said Raymonde. &#8220;You
flung out your arms, Morvyth, and gave me such
a whack across the face! I wonder I haven&#8217;t a
black eye. Let&#8217;s turn the other way, with our feet
to the pole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are! I&#8217;m so sleepy, I don&#8217;t mind
which end up I am, if I can only shut my eyes!&#8221;
conceded Katherine, yawning lustily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t need rocking, either,&#8221; agreed Morvyth.</p>
<p>Perched on her hay-bag, Raymonde was very
soon in the land of Nod. She was dreaming a confused
jumble about Miss Gibbs and gipsies and
strawberries, when she suddenly awoke with a
strong impression that someone was pulling her
hair. She sat up, feeling rather scared. The tent
was perfectly quiet. The other girls lay asleep,
each on her own sack with her feet to the central
pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have dreamt it!&#8221; thought Raymonde,
settling down again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>She had scarcely closed her eyes, however, before
she heard a curious noise in the vicinity of her
ear, and something unmistakably gave her plait a
violent wrench. She started up with a yell, in time
to see an enormous head withdraw itself from the
tent door. A clatter of hoofs followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; cried the girls, waking
at the disturbance; and &#8220;What is it?&#8221; exclaimed
Miss Gibbs, aroused also, and hurrying in from the
next-door tent. But Raymonde was laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had the fright of my life!&#8221; she announced.
&#8220;I thought a bogy or a kelpie was devouring me,
but it was only Dandy, the old pony. He stuck
his head round the tent door, and mistook my hair
for a mouthful of grass, the wretch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him feeding near the tents before,&#8221;
said Valentine. &#8220;There&#8217;s some particular sort of
grass here that he specially likes. It&#8217;s rather the
limit, though, to have him coming inside!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He oughtn&#8217;t to be allowed in this field at
night,&#8221; declared Miss Gibbs. &#8220;I shall speak to
Mr. Cox, and ask to have him put in another
pasture. We can&#8217;t close our tent doors, or we
should be suffocated. I hope we shan&#8217;t have any
other nocturnal visitors! It&#8217;s a good thing we
have no valuables with us. I don&#8217;t trust those
gipsies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs&#8217;s fears turned out to be only too well
founded, for, on the morning but one following,
there was a hue and cry in the camp. The larder
had been raided during the night, and all the provisions
stolen. The canteen matron and the cook
were in despair, as nothing was left for breakfast,
and the workers would have gone hungry, had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
a deputation of them visited the farm, and begged
sufficient bread and jam to provide a meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lovely ham gone, and four pounds of butter,
and a joint of cold beef, and all the bread!&#8221;
mourned the distracted matron. &#8220;I shall have
to go in to Ledcombe again this morning for fresh
supplies, and I believe Mr. Cox wants the pony
himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be able to track the thieves,&#8221; said
Miss Gibbs firmly. &#8220;There should be an inspection
at lunch-time, and anyone seen eating ham
should be under suspicion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d be far too clever to eat it publicly,&#8221;
objected Miss Hoyle, the lady journalist. &#8220;Gipsies
are an uncommonly tricky set. They probably
had a midnight feast, and finished the last crumb
of our provisions before daybreak. We shall get
no satisfaction from Mr. Cox. He&#8217;ll say he&#8217;s not
responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we must take precautions that it doesn&#8217;t
happen again,&#8221; decreed Miss Gibbs. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it
possible to procure a lock-up meat safe? I never
heard of a camp being without one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you haven&#8217;t had much experience,&#8221;
remarked the canteen matron icily. She thought
Miss Gibbs &#8220;bossy&#8221; and interfering, and considered
that she knew her own business best, without
suggestions from outsiders.</p>
<p>The Grange girls chuckled inwardly to hear
their teacher thus snubbed. They hoped a retort
and even a wrangle might follow; but Miss Gibbs
had too much common sense, and, restraining herself,
stalked away with as unconcerned an aspect as
possible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, old sport!&#8221; whispered Raymonde
to Morvyth, &#8220;somebody ought to take this matter
up. I consider it&#8217;s a job for us. Let&#8217;s watch to-night,
and see if we can&#8217;t catch the prowling sneaks.
Are you game?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather! It&#8217;s a blossomy idea, only don&#8217;t let
Gibbie get wind of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I ever go and tell Gibbie my jinky little
plans? It&#8217;s not this child&#8217;s usual way of proceeding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde and Morvyth had intended to run
this little expedition &#8220;on their own,&#8221; but in the
end they were obliged to let the rest of the tent into
the secret, as it was impossible to go to bed fully
dressed without exciting comment. Their comrades
refused to be left out, so it was decided that all six,
under Raymonde&#8217;s leadership, should mount guard
over the larder. They drew their blankets up to
their noses, and pretended to be very sleepy when
Miss Gibbs came to take a last look at them before
retiring. Apparently she noticed nothing unusual,
for she only glanced quickly round, and went softly
away. The self-constituted sentries allowed nearly
an hour to pass before they dared to venture forth.
Until that time the camp was not really quiet.
The university students were a lively set, apt to
keep up their fun late, and the secondary school
girls often talked persistently, to the annoyance of
their neighbours. At last, however, all lights were
out, and a profound silence reigned. Not even
an owl hooted to-night, and, as Dandy had been
banished from the field, even his crunching of
the grass was absent. Raymonde crept from her
blankets and listened. Her companions, to judge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
from their breathing, were sound asleep. She felt
much tempted to awaken only Morvyth, but she
knew that if she omitted to call the others, their
reproaches next morning would be too unbearable.
So she roused the five. Taking torchlights,
ready but not switched on, they stole from the tent
towards the scene of action.</p>
<p>The larder was only a portion of the marquee
curtained off, so it was really an easy prey for
marauders. The girls could not quite decide where
would be their best post for sentry duty; whether
to dispose themselves in positions outside, or to
keep guard within the tent. As it was rather a
cold night, they plumped for the latter. Cautiously
as Indians on the war trail, they crept across the
marquee towards the farther corner where the stores
were kept. Raymonde, as leader, went first, with
her body-guard in close attendance behind her.
Very, very gently she drew back the curtains and
entered the larder. It was pitch-dark in here, and
she began to grope her way along the wall. Then
she stopped, for in front of her she fancied she
heard breathing. She listened&mdash;all was silent.
She started again, intending to go to the far side
of the table. She put out her hand to guide herself,
and came in contact with something warm and
soft, like human flesh. In spite of herself she could
not suppress an exclamation. It was too horrible,
actually to touch a burglar! She had not bargained
to find one already in possession of the larder.
Instantly the girls behind her flashed on their torchlights,
and the little sentry party found themselves
confronted with&mdash;Miss Gibbs!</p>
<p>Yes, it was Miss Gibbs, crouching down near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
the table with Miss Hoyle, the lady journalist,
close to her, both looking very determined, and
ready to tackle any number of gipsy thieves. The
astonishment was mutual.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here, girls?&#8221; asked Miss
Gibbs sharply, the schoolmistress in her rising to
the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only trying to guard the larder!&#8221; faltered Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; explained Miss
Hoyle.</p>
<p>At that moment the matron put in an appearance.
She also had been on the qui vive in defence of her
stores, and hearing voices, was sure she had trapped
the thieves. She had already passed on the alarm,
and in a few moments, acting on a preconcerted
signal, Mr. Cox and several of the farm hands
burst upon the scene, ready to knock down and
secure intruders. Explanations naturally followed.
It seemed that nearly everyone in the camp had
private and separately arranged watch parties, each
unconscious of the others&#8217; vigilance, and that all
had mistaken their neighbours for burglars. No
one quite knew at first whether to be annoyed or
amused, but in the end humour won, and a general
laugh ensued. As nobody felt disposed to spend
the whole night on sentry duty, the matter was
settled by Miss Corley and Miss Hoyle proposing
to bring their beds and sleep in the marquee for the
future.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wake easily, so I should hear the very faintest
footstep, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Miss Hoyle. &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to keep a revolver under my pillow, too, and I hope
you&#8217;ll spread that information all over the gardens,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
and add that I&#8217;m accustomed to use it, and would
as soon shoot a man as look at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether through fear of Miss Hoyle&#8217;s bloodthirsty
intentions, or with a shrewd suspicion that
Mr. Cox was on the watch, the marauders did not
repeat their midnight visit, and left the camp in
peace. Miss Hoyle seemed almost disappointed.
Being a journalist, she had perhaps hoped to make
copy of the adventure, and write a sparkling column
for her newspaper. The Grange girls decided that
it was not the revolver, but the dread of Miss Gibbs
which had scared away the gipsies.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve seen her in the fields, you know, and
I should think one look would be enough,&#8221; said
Morvyth. &#8220;She has a &#8216;Come here, my good man,
and let me argue the matter out with you&#8217; expression
on her face this last day or two that should daunt
the most foolhardy. If she caught a burglar she&#8217;d
certainly sit him down and rub social reform and
political economy into him before she let him go!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>Canteen Assistants</h3>
</div>
<p>The many acres of strawberry gardens were situated
some little distance from the camp, so that the
walk backwards and forwards occupied about a
quarter of an hour each way. Once work was
begun, nobody returned to the tents except on some
very urgent errand, as the loss of time involved
would be great. A really valid excuse occurred
one morning, however. Aveline missed her watch,
and remembered that she had laid it on the breakfast
table in the marquee. It seemed very unsafe
to leave it there, so she reported the matter to Miss
Gibbs, who told her to go at once and fetch it, and
sent Raymonde with her, not liking her to have
the walk alone. The two girls were rather glad of
the excuse. They were not shirkers, but the picking
made their backs tired, and the run through
the fields was a welcome change. They found the
watch still lying on the table in the marquee, and
Aveline clasped it round her wrist.</p>
<p>They were leaving the tent when Miss Jones, the
canteen matron, bustled in, looking so worried that
they ventured to ask: &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped, as if it were a relief to explode.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter, indeed! You&#8217;ll have no potatoes or
vegetables for your dinner, that&#8217;s all, and nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
at all for your supper! Mrs. Harper hasn&#8217;t turned
up, and I can&#8217;t leave the place with nobody about.
I meant to go to Ledcombe this morning for fresh
supplies, and it&#8217;s early-closing day, too, the shops
will shut at one. Oh, dear! I can&#8217;t think what&#8217;s
to be done! These village helps are more trouble
than they&#8217;re worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harper, the cook, had failed the camp
before, taking an occasional day off, without any
previous notice, to attend to her domestic affairs
at home. Miss Jones knew from former experience
that she would either stroll in casually about midday,
or more probably would not come at all until
to-morrow. In the meantime fifty people required
meals, and the situation was urgent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we go to Ledcombe for you?&#8221; suggested
Raymonde.</p>
<p>The matron&#8217;s face cleared; she jumped at the
proposition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geordie&#8217;s somewhere about the buildings. He&#8217;d
harness the pony for you, if you can manage to
drive. I&#8217;ll give you a list of what&#8217;s needed. The
meat&#8217;s come, and I can put that on to stew, and get
the puddings ready, and if you&#8217;ll be back by eleven
there&#8217;ll be time to wash the potatoes. It&#8217;s only
half-past eight now. I&#8217;ll write down all I want
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was impossible to go back to the gardens and
ask permission from Miss Gibbs. The girls considered
that the matron&#8217;s authority was sufficient
to justify the expedition, which was certainly for
the benefit of the camp. Neither of them had ever
handled the reins in her life before, so the drive
would be a decided adventure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>Armed with a long list of necessaries, two huge
market baskets, and Miss Jones&#8217;s hand-bag containing
a supply of money, they started off to the
farm to find Geordie, a half-witted boy who did
odd jobs about the fold-yard. After a considerable
hunt through the barns they discovered him at last
inside the pigsty, and bribed him with twopence to
go and catch the pony. Dandy was enjoying himself
in the field, and did not come readily; indeed,
the girls were almost despairing before he was
finally led in by his forelock. The little conveyance
was a small, very old-fashioned gig, and
though in its far-off youth it may have possessed
a smart appearance, it was now decidedly more
useful than ornamental. The varnish was worn
and scratched, the cushions had been re-covered
with cheap American cloth, the waterproof apron
was threadbare, and one of the splash-boards was
split. The harness also was of the most ancient
description, and the rough pony badly needed
clipping, so that the whole turn-out was deplorably
shabby and second-rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hardly the kind of thing one would drive
in round the Park!&#8221; laughed Aveline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarcely! It&#8217;s the queerest little egg-box on
two wheels I&#8217;ve ever seen. But what does it
matter? Nobody knows us in Ledcombe. The
main point is, will it get us over the ground?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish we&#8217;d bicycles instead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we couldn&#8217;t bring back a whole cargo of
stores on them. I think it&#8217;s top-hole!&#8221;</p>
<p>With much laughter and many little jokes the
girls tucked themselves into their funny conveyance,
evidently greatly to the interest of Dandy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
who turned his head anxiously as they mounted
the step.</p>
<p>&#8220;He do be a wise &#8217;un!&#8221; explained Geordie.
&#8220;You see, sometimes Mr. Rivers takes his father-in-law,
as weighs seventeen stone, and, with a calf
or maybe a young pig as well, it do make a big
load. Dandy don&#8217;t be one to overwork hisself.
I reckon you&#8217;ll have to use the whip to he!&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither of the girls had even the most elementary
experience of driving, but Raymonde, as the elder,
and the one who in general possessed the greater
amount of nerve, boldly seized the reins and armed
herself with the whip. Geordie released Dandy&#8217;s
head, and gave him a sounding smack as a delicate
hint to depart, a proceeding which brought clouds
of dust from his shaggy coat, and caused him to
scramble suddenly forward, and plunge down the
lane at quite an adventurous and stylish pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he won&#8217;t go, just cuss at him!&#8221; yelled
Geordie as a last piece of advice.</p>
<p>Though Dandy might make a gallant beginning,
he had no intention of breaking the record for speed,
and at the end of a few hundred yards dropped into
an ambling jog-trot, a form of locomotion which
seemed to jolt the badly hung little gig to its
uttermost.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather a painful form of exercise!&#8221; gasped
Aveline, setting her feet firmly in an attempt to
avoid the jarring. &#8220;I believe something must be
wrong with the springs. Can&#8217;t you make him go
faster?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only if I beat him; and then suppose he runs
away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if he does, we&#8217;ll each cling on to one rein
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
and pull. I suppose driving is pretty much like
steering a bicycle. Is the rule of the road the
same?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Don&#8217;t be silly !&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never can make out why it&#8217;s different
for foot-passengers. Why should they go to the
right, and vehicles to the left?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be certain all motors will take the
middle of the road, at any rate. We shall have
to be prepared to make a dash for the hedge when
we hear a &#8216;too-hoo&#8217; round the corner. I&#8217;ve no
mind to be run over and squashed out flat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like the naughty children who teased Diogenes
in an old picture-book I used to have. I always
thought it was a lovely idea of his to start the tub
rolling, and simply flatten them out like pancakes.
I expect it&#8217;s a true incident, if we only knew. One
of those things that are not historical, but so probable
that you&#8217;re sure they must have happened.
He&#8217;d reason it out by philosophy first, and feel it
was a triumph of mind over matter. Perhaps his
chuckles when he saw the result were the origin
of the term &#8216;a cynical laugh&#8217;. The children in the
picture looked so exactly like pieces of rolled pastry
when the tub had done its work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the motors would have any more
compunction than Diogenes, so the moral is&mdash;give
them as wide a berth as possible. If we were driving
a big hay-cart, I&#8217;d enjoy blocking the way!&#8221;</p>
<p>They had turned out of the lane, and were now
on the high road to Ledcombe, but progressing at
an extremely slow pace. Raymonde ventured to
apply the whip, but on the pony&#8217;s thick coat it
appeared to produce as slight an impression as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
tickling of a fly, and, when she endeavoured to give
a more efficacious flick, she got the lash ignominiously
entangled in the harness. There was nothing
for it but to pull up, and for Aveline to climb
laboriously from the trap, and release the much-knotted
piece of string. Rendered more careful by
this catastrophe, Raymonde wielded her whip with
caution, and gave what encouragement she could
by jerking the reins vigorously, and occasionally
ejaculating an energetic &#8220;Go on, Dandy!&#8221; The
pony, however, was a cunning little creature, and,
knowing perfectly well that he was in amateur
hands, took full advantage of the situation. Under
the excuse of a very slight hill he reduced his pace
to a crawl, and began to crop succulent mouthfuls
of grass from the hedge-bank, as a means of combining
pleasure with business. It was only by
judicious proddings with the butt-end of the whip
that he could be induced to hasten his steps.</p>
<p>In spite of the difficulties with Dandy, the drive
was enjoyable. The country was very pretty, for
they were nearing the hills, and the landscape was
more diversified than in the immediate neighbourhood
of the camp. They passed through a beech
wood, where the sun was glinting through leaves
as transparent and delicate as fairies&#8217; wings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like primeval man to-day,&#8221; said Aveline.
&#8220;The wander fever is on me, and I want to see
fresh things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be in Ledcombe soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean towns; it&#8217;s something much subtler&mdash;different
fields, unexplored woods, a new piece of
river, or even a patch of grass with flowers I haven&#8217;t
found before.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; agreed Raymonde. &#8220;It&#8217;s the feeling
one had when one was small, and read about how
the youngest prince set out into the great wide
world to seek his fortune. I always envied him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or the knights-errant&mdash;they had a splendid
time roaming through the forest, and tilting a spear
against anyone who was ready for single combat.
One might lead a very merry life yet, like Robin
Hood and his band, in the &#8216;good greenwood&#8217;,
though we shouldn&#8217;t be &#8216;hunting the King&#8217;s red
deer&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was pretty much like camp life, I dare say,
only a little rougher than ours. More like the
gipsy diggings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking of gipsies, I believe you&#8217;ve conjured
them up. That looks like a caravan over there.
I expect it is some more of the tribe coming to pick
strawberries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gipsies, collected in a group in the roadway,
were loudly bewailing a catastrophe, for their horse
had just fallen down dead. Until they could obtain
another they must needs stay by the roadside, and
could not get on to the gardens.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a handsome set,&#8221; said Aveline, taking
out her camera, which she had brought with her.
&#8220;Just look at the children!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the mother that attracts me most,&#8221; said
Raymonde.</p>
<p>The woman, indeed, was a beautiful specimen of
Romany blood, tall and dark, with great flashing
eyes and coarse black hair. She resembled a man
more than the gentler sex. She wore a very short
red skirt, and had a little barrel hung over her
shoulder by a strap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d brought my camera!&#8221; murmured
Raymonde. &#8220;I simply hadn&#8217;t room to stuff it in.
It was a choice between it and my night-gear, and
I thought Gibbie&#8217;d treat me to jaw-wag if I left
out my pyjamas.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aveline descended from the trap to take her
photo, hoping to get a snapshot of the gipsies, just
as they were, grouped in dramatic attitudes round
the dead horse. At the sight of two well-dressed
strangers, however, the tribal instincts asserted
themselves, and the woman was pushed hurriedly
forward by the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell your fortune, my pretty lady!&#8221; she began
to Aveline in a half-bold, half-wheedling voice.
&#8220;Cross the poor gipsy&#8217;s hand with a shilling and
she&#8217;ll read the stars for you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thanks!&#8221; said Aveline, rather scared by the
woman&#8217;s jaunty, impudent manner. &#8220;I only
wanted to take a photo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cross the gipsy&#8217;s hand first, lady, before you
take her photo. Don&#8217;t you want to know the
future, lady? I can read something in your face
that will surprise you. Just a shilling, lady&mdash;only
a shilling!&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the tribe were approaching the trap
and begging from Raymonde, looking so rough and
importunate that the girls began to be thoroughly
alarmed, and afraid for the safety of the money they
had brought with them. Aveline regretted her
folly in having dismounted from the gig, and
backed towards it again, pestered by the gipsy.
She did not want a photo now, only to get away as
swiftly as possible. But that the dark-eyed crew
did not seem disposed to allow. A dusky hand was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
laid on the pony&#8217;s reins, and a voluble tongue
poured forth a jumble of planets and predictions.
The situation had grown extremely unpleasant for
the girls, when fortunately a cart was seen coming
in the distance. The gipsies melted away instantly,
Aveline jumped into the trap, and Raymonde
whipped up Dandy, who evidently resenting on his
own account the tribe&#8217;s interference, set off at a
swinging pace, and soon left the caravan behind.
In another ten minutes they had reached the outskirts
of Ledcombe, and arrived at civilization.</p>
<p>The little country town was one of those sleepy
places where you could almost shoot a cannon down
the High Street without injuring anybody. There
were shops with antiquated-looking goods in the
windows; a market hall, closed except on Tuesdays;
a church with a picturesque tower, a bank, and a
large number of public-houses. It seemed to the
girls as if almost every other building displayed
a green dragon, or a red lion, or a black boar, or
some other sign to indicate that the excessive thirst
of the inhabitants could be satisfied within. Raymonde
felt rather nervous at driving in the town,
but fortunately, being a Thursday morning, there
was little traffic in the streets. Had it been market
day she might have got into difficulties. She sat
outside in the gig while Aveline went into the shops
and purchased the various commodities on Miss
Jones&#8217;s list. These were so many, that by the time
everything had been bought the gig was crammed
to overflowing, leaving only just room for the two
girls. Raymonde sat with her feet on a sack of
potatoes, Aveline clutched the big baskets full of
loaves and vegetables, while parcels were piled up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
on the floor and on the seat. Their business had
taken them longer than they expected, and the
church clock warned them that they must hurry if
the potatoes were to be cooked in time for dinner.
As soon as they were clear of the town, Raymonde
attempted to communicate the urgency of the case
to Dandy. Her efforts were in vain, however. That
faithless quadruped utterly refused to proceed faster
than an ambling jog-trot, and took no notice of
whipping, prodding or poking, beyond flicking his
ears as if he thought the flies were troublesome.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall never get back to the camp at this
rate,&#8221; lamented Raymonde. &#8220;What are we to
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Geordie suggested &#8216;cuss words&#8217;,&#8221; grinned
Aveline. &#8220;I expect that&#8217;s what Dandy&#8217;s accustomed
to from most of his drivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;d be particular as to the
exact words,&#8221; said Raymonde. &#8220;Probably it&#8217;s the
tone of voice that does it. Let&#8217;s wait till he gets to
the top of this hill, then I&#8217;ll prod him again, and
we&#8217;ll both growl out &#8216;Go on!&#8217; and see if it has any
effect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it hasn&#8217;t, I shall lead him and run by his
head. It would be quicker than this pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try shouting first. Here we are at the
top of the hill. Now, both together, in the gruffest
voice you can muster. Are you ready? One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Go
on, Dandy</span>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it was really the result of the deep bass
tones, or Raymonde&#8217;s unexpected prod, or merely
the fact that they had arrived at the summit of the
slope, the girls could not determine, but the effect
on the pony was instantaneous. He gathered all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
four legs together, and gave a sudden jump, apparently
of apprehension, then set off down the hill
as fast as he could tear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold him in!&#8221; yelled Aveline, alarmed at such
an access of speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to!&#8221; replied Raymonde, pulling at
the reins as hard as her arms would allow.</p>
<p>Dandy, however, seemed determined for once to
show his paces, and took no more notice of Raymonde&#8217;s
checking than he had previously done of
her urgings. The little trap was flying like the
wind, when without the least warning a most unanticipated
thing happened. The worn, crazy old
straps of the harness broke, and the pony, giving
a wrench that also snapped the reins, ran straight
out of the shafts. The gig promptly fell forward,
precipitating both girls, amid a shower of parcels,
into the road, where they sat for a moment or two
almost dazed with the shock, watching the retreating
heels of Dandy as he fled in terror of the
dangling straps that were hitting him on the flanks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221; asked Raymonde at last, getting
up and tenderly feeling her scraped shins.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only rather bruised&mdash;and astonished,&#8221; replied
Aveline.</p>
<p>Then the humour of the situation seemed to strike
both, for they burst into peals of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we to do with the trap?&#8221; said Aveline.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t drag it back ourselves. And what about
the pony? He&#8217;s playing truant!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mr. Rivers said he was so quiet and well-behaved
that a baby in arms could drive him!&#8221;
declared Raymonde, much aggrieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they shouldn&#8217;t patch their harness with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
bits of string!&#8221; said Aveline. &#8220;It&#8217;s very unsafe. I
noticed it before we started out, but I supposed it
would be all right. Hallo! Here&#8217;s Dandy back!
Somebody&#8217;s caught him!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the gipsy woman who made her appearance,
leading the pony. She looked rather scared,
and much relieved when she saw Raymonde and
Aveline standing safe and sound in the middle of
the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought for sure someone was killed!&#8221; she
remarked when she reached the scene of the accident.
Though the girls had been frightened of her
before, they were glad to see her now, for they had
no notion what to do next. She at once assumed
command of the situation, sent one of the children,
who had followed her, back to the caravan to fetch
her husband, and with his assistance set to work
and patched up the harness.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re tinkers by trade, lady, so we know how
to put in a rivet or two, enough to take you safely
home, at any rate; but they don&#8217;t ought to send
that harness out again, it&#8217;s as rotten as can be.
Mr. Rivers&#8217;s, did you say? Why, it&#8217;s his farm as
we&#8217;re going to, to pick strawberries, as soon as we
can get there, with our horse lying dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind, and
before the harness was mended the girls had struck
up quite a friendship with the gipsies, which was
further cemented by the transference of half a crown
from Raymonde&#8217;s purse to the brown hand of the
woman, and the bestowal of the greater part of
Aveline&#8217;s chocolates into the mouths of the dark-eyed
children.</p>
<p>Dandy was placed between the shafts once more,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
and the parcels were restored to the gig. The girls,
being doubtful as to the security of the hastily-mended
harness, did not venture to mount inside,
but led the pony by the head, lest he should be
inspired to race down another hill. It was a slow
progress back, and the workers were just returning
from the fields as they reached the camp. Naturally
there were no potatoes for dinner that day, though
Raymonde and Aveline congratulated themselves
that the bread was just in time. They were the
heroines of the hour when they related their adventures,
and even Miss Gibbs did not scold them,
though they afterwards heard her remarking to
Miss Hoyle that Miss Jones was a poor manager,
and ought to make better arrangements about
catering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gibbie&#8217;s got to let fly at somebody!&#8221; chuckled
Raymonde. &#8220;If it can&#8217;t be us, it&#8217;s someone else, but
she&#8217;d better not try criticizing Miss Jones&#8217;s methods
to her face, or there&#8217;ll be fighting in the camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t I like to see a match between them!&#8221;
sighed Aveline. &#8220;I&#8217;d stake my all on Gibbie, any
day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Raymonde reflectively.
&#8220;Gibbie has fire and spirit, and powers of sarcasm,
and traditions of Scotch ancestry; but there&#8217;s a
suggestion of icy stubbornness about Miss Jones
that looks capable of standing out against anybody
with bulldog grit. I believe I&#8217;d back Miss Jones,
if it came to the point!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>Amateur Detectives</h3>
</div>
<p>The girls felt that their short week of strawberry
picking was crammed more full of experiences than
a whole term of ordinary school life. There were
so many interesting people at the camp who had
been working at various absorbing occupations,
and were ready to talk about their adventures.
Miss Hoyle could give accounts of celebrities
whom she had been sent to interview by her newspaper;
Miss Gordon, the Social Settlement secretary,
had stories of factory girls and their funny
ways and sayings to relate; Nurse Gibbons had
much to tell about her training in a London
hospital; Miss Parker was an authority on munition
work, and Miss Lowe, an artist, drew spirited
sketches of everybody and everything, to the
amusement of all. There was a great feeling of
comradeship and bonhomie in the camp; everyone
was ready to be friendly, and to meet everybody
else on equal terms. There was only one
member who did not seem responsive and ready
to mix with the others. This was Mrs. Vernon,
a shy, reserved little woman, who never blossomed
out into any confidences. She would sit and listen
attentively to all the tales told by Miss Hoyle and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
Miss Parker, and would even question the latter
about her munition work, but she gave no information
at all respecting herself or her occupation. It
was rumoured that she was a widow, but the report
was not confirmed. The Marlowe Grange girls
did not much like her, and took very little notice
of her. It was the easiest thing in the world to
ignore her, for she seemed to shrink from even
the most ordinary civilities, and would vouchsafe
nothing but a curt reply when spoken to.</p>
<p>On the morning after the expedition to Ledcombe
there was considerable excitement in Raymonde&#8217;s
tent. Katherine woke up with her face covered
with a rash. Morvyth, who slept next to her,
noticed it immediately, and told her that she had
better stay in bed until Miss Gibbs saw her.
Naturally Miss Gibbs was in a state of great apprehension,
and feared that Katherine must be sickening
for measles, scarlatina, chicken-pox, or some
other infectious complaint. Manifestly the first
thing to be done was to send for a doctor. The
nearest medical man lived at Ledcombe, and in
order to save time Raymonde and Aveline offered
to walk in to Shipley village, and telephone to him
from the post office there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice little business if Kitty starts an epidemic
in the camp!&#8221; said Aveline as they went along.
&#8220;I suppose we couldn&#8217;t go back to school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, and we shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to pick strawberries
either, if we were infectious. They&#8217;d turn us
out of the camp, and treat us like lepers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I say! It would be no fun at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached Shipley by this time&mdash;a little
quaint old-world place consisting of one village
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
street of picturesque cottages, most of them covered
with roses or vines, and with flowery gardens in
front. The tiny church stood on a mound, surrounded
by trees, and looked far smaller than the
handsome vicarage whose great gates opened opposite
the school. The post office appeared also to
be a general store, where articles of every description
were on sale. From the ceiling were suspended
tin pails, coils of clothes-line, rows of boots or
shoes, pans, kettles, brooms, and lanterns, while
the walls were lined with shelves containing
groceries and draperies, stationery, hosiery, quack
medicines, garden seeds, and, in fact, an absolutely
miscellaneous assortment of goods and chattels,
some old, some new, some fresh, some faded, some
appetizing, and some decidedly stale.</p>
<p>Raymonde asked to use the telephone, and retired
to the little boxed-off portion of the shop reserved
for that instrument, where she successfully rang
up Dr. Wilton, and received his promise to call
during the morning at the camp. This most pressing
business done, they proceeded to execute a
few commissions for Miss Jones, Miss Lowe, and
several other members of the party. Miss Hoyle
had begged them to buy a few yards of anything
with which she might trim a large shady rush hat
she had brought with her, so the girls asked the
postmistress to show them some white ribbon.
That elderly spinster, having first, with considerable
ingenuity, satisfied her curiosity as to the
object for which they required it, commenced a
vigorous hunt among the miscellaneous collection
of boxes in her establishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I have some,&#8221; she soliloquized, &#8220;for it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
was only six weeks ago I sold a yard and a half to
Mrs. Cox, to finish a tea-cosy she was making.
Where can I have put it? No, this is lead-pencils
and india-rubber, and this, neuralgic powders and
babies&#8217; comforters. It might have got into the
small wares, but I had that out only yesterday.
Why, here it is, after all, among the tapes and
buttons!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls soon found that shopping at Shipley
possessed an immense advantage over kindred expeditions
in town. When there was only a single
article, no selection could be made; it was impossible
to be bewildered with too many fineries, and
&#8220;This or nothing&#8221; offered a unique simplicity in
the way of choice. Miss Pearson, the postmistress,
decided for them that the ribbon was the right
width and quality, and even offered a few hints on
the subject of trimming.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she&#8217;s longing to do it herself!&#8221; whispered
Aveline. &#8220;Are those specimens of her millinery
in the window? I&#8217;d as soon wear a cauliflower
on my head as that erection with the squirms of
velvet and the lace border!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure three yards will be sufficient?&#8221;
pattered the little storekeeper. &#8220;Well, of course
you can come for more if you want. I&#8217;m not likely
to be selling it out, and, if anybody should happen
to come and ask for the rest of it, I&#8217;ll get them to
wait till you&#8217;ve finished trimming your hat. Dear
me! If I haven&#8217;t mislaid my scissors now! I was
cutting flowers with them in the garden before
breakfast, and I must have put them down in the
middle of the sweet peas, or on the onion bed. It
wouldn&#8217;t take me five minutes to find them. You&#8217;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
rather not wait? Then perhaps you&#8217;ll excuse my
using this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further apology, Miss Pearson seized
the carving-knife with which she usually operated
on the cheese and bacon, and, giving it a hasty
wipe upon her apron, proceeded to saw through
the ribbon, wrapping up the three yards in a scrap
of newspaper.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m out of paper bags,&#8221; she announced
airily, &#8220;but the traveller only calls once in six
months. Let me know how you get on with the
hat, and, if you want any help that I can give you,
just bring it across to me, and I&#8217;ll do my best. By
the by, I suppose you young ladies go to a fine
boarding-school? Do you learn foreign languages
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;French and German and Latin&mdash;most
of us,&#8221; replied Raymonde, rather astonished.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you&#8217;ll be so good as to help me,
for there&#8217;s a letter arrived this morning I can make
nothing of. It&#8217;s certainly not in English, but
whether it&#8217;s in French or German or Russian or
what, I can&#8217;t say, for I&#8217;m no authority on languages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me look at it, and I will do my best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Pearson bustled to her postmistress&#8217;s desk,
and with an air of great importance produced the
letter. Raymonde took it carelessly enough, but
when she had grasped a few sentences her expression
changed. She read it through to the end,
then laid it down on the counter without offering
to translate.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not addressed to you, I think,&#8221; she
remarked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re quite right, it&#8217;s for Martha Verney; but
she&#8217;s no scholar, so I opened it for her, like I do
for many folks in Shipley. I was quite taken
aback when I couldn&#8217;t make it out, and Martha
said: &#8216;Miss Pearson, if you can&#8217;t read it, I&#8217;m sure
nobody else can!&#8217; But I told her to leave it, in
case anyone came into the shop who could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the envelope?&#8221; asked Raymonde
briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s here. The writing is small and queer, isn&#8217;t
it? I had to put on both my pairs of glasses, one
over the other, before I could see properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made a very great mistake,&#8221; said Raymonde.
&#8220;The letter is addressed to Mrs. Vernon,
Poste Restante, Shipley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never! I thought it was Martha
Verney. There are no Vernons in Shipley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a Mrs. Vernon at the camp. No
doubt it&#8217;s intended for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am sorry,&#8221; replied Miss Pearson. &#8220;To
think of me being postmistress all these years, and
making such a mistake! I&#8217;ll put it in an official
envelope and readdress it. She&#8217;ll get it to-morrow.
Is it important? I suppose you were able to understand
it?&#8221; with a suggestive glance at the letter, as
if she hoped Raymonde would reveal its contents.</p>
<p>Raymonde, however, did not answer her question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you had better seal it up at once,&#8221; she
parried, &#8220;and drop it into the box, and then you&#8217;ll
feel you&#8217;ve finished with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it will be all right! I hope I know my
duties. If people addressed their envelopes properly
in a plain hand, there&#8217;d be no mistakes,&#8221;
snapped Miss Pearson, highly offended, putting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
back the bone of contention among her papers, and
locking the desk. She knew she had been caught
tripping, and wished to preserve her official dignity
as far as possible. &#8220;I&#8217;ve opened Martha Verney&#8217;s
letters for the last fifteen years, and had no complaints,&#8221;
she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ave,&#8221; said Raymonde, as the two girls left the
shop and turned up the lane towards the camp,
&#8220;that was a most important letter. I didn&#8217;t tell
that old curiosity-box so, but it was written in
German. I&#8217;d Fr&auml;ulein as my governess for four
years before I came to school, so I can read German
pretty easily, as you know. Well, I couldn&#8217;t
quite understand everything, but the general drift
seems to be that Mrs. Vernon has a husband or
a brother or a cousin named Carl, who is interned
not so far away from here, and is trying to escape.
This evening&#8217;s the time fixed, and he&#8217;s coming into
the neighbourhood of our camp, and she&#8217;s to meet
him, and give him clothes and money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious! What are we to do? Go back
and &#8217;phone to the police&mdash;or tell Mr. Rivers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; said Raymonde decidedly. &#8220;After
that idiotic business on Wednesday night, trying
to guard the larder with everybody tumbling over
everyone else, it&#8217;s worse than useless to tell. It
would be all over the camp in five minutes, and
Mrs. Vernon would hear about it, and go and warn
&#8216;Carl&#8217; somehow. As for the police, they&#8217;d spend
a week in preliminaries. They&#8217;d have to send a
constable to look at the letter, and ask questions of
us, and Miss Pearson, and Mr. Rivers, and no end
of red-tape nonsense; and by that time Carl would
be safely out of the country, and on to a neutral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
vessel. No, my idea is to &#8216;set a thief to catch a
thief&#8217;. I&#8217;m going to ask the gipsies to help us. If
anybody can deal with the business, they can!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Topping!&#8221; exclaimed Aveline. &#8220;I&#8217;d back the
gipsies against the best detectives in England.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to the field and talk to that woman who
caught Dandy for us yesterday. Mr. Rivers sent
a horse last night, and brought their caravan to the
farm, so they&#8217;ll all be at work picking this morning.
Don&#8217;t tell a single soul in the camp. You and I
will watch Mrs. Vernon, and follow her if she goes
out, and the gipsies shall keep guard in the wood
where she&#8217;s evidently arranged to meet him. They&#8217;ll
get a reward if they catch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll spur them on, as well as the sport of the
thing!&#8221; laughed Aveline.</p>
<p>The girls were fearfully excited at the idea of
such an adventure. They had never liked Mrs.
Vernon, and now saw good ground for their suspicions.
They wondered how much information
she had gleaned at the camp, for Miss Hoyle and
Miss Parker were not very discreet in their communications.
They walked at once to the gardens,
found their Romany friend among the strawberries,
and with much secrecy told her the whole affair.
As they had expected, she rose magnificently to
the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You leave it to us gipsies,&#8221; she assured them.
&#8220;Bless you, we&#8217;re used to this kind of job. There&#8217;s
a lot of us altogether working here, and I&#8217;ll pass the
word on. There&#8217;ll be scouts this evening behind
nearly every hedge, and if any German comes this
way we&#8217;ll get him, I promise you. You keep your
eye on that Mrs. Vernon! We may want a signal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
Look here, lady; come to the back of that shed, and
I&#8217;ll teach you the gipsies&#8217; whistle. Anybody with
Romany blood in them&#8217;s bound to answer it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gipsy&#8217;s whistle was a peculiar bird-like call,
not very easy to imitate. Raymonde had to try again
and again before she could accomplish it to her
instructress&#8217;s satisfaction. At last, however, she
had it perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t use it till you must,&#8221; cautioned her dark-eyed
confederate; &#8220;but, if we hear it, it will bring
the lot of us out. Now I must go back to my picking,
or the agent will be turning me off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I must rush back to the camp,&#8221; declared
Raymonde, remembering that Miss Gibbs, who
had stayed with the invalid, would expect a report
of the visit to the telephone. The excitement of
the German letter had temporarily banished
Katherine&#8217;s illness from her thoughts, and she
reproached herself for her unkindness in forgetting
her friend. The doctor called during the course
of the morning, and, after examining the patient,
pronounced her complaint to be neither measles,
chicken-pox, nor anything of an infectious character,
but merely a rash due to the eating of too
many strawberries.</p>
<p>&#8220;They cause violent dyspepsia in some people,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;I will make up a bottle of medicine,
if you can send anybody over on a bicycle for
it this afternoon. You mustn&#8217;t eat any more strawberries,
young lady. They&#8217;d be simply poison to
you at present. Oh yes! you may go and pick
them; the occupation will do you no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much relieved that they had not started a centre
of infection in the camp, Katherine and Miss Gibbs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
returned to work after lunch, the latter issuing
special instructions to her girls against the excessive
consumption of the fruit they were gathering.
Katherine was inclined to pose as an interesting
invalid, and to claim sympathy, but the general
feeling of her schoolfellows was against that attitude,
and the verdict was &#8220;Greedy pig! Serves
her right!&#8221; which was not at all to her satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re most unkind!&#8221; she wailed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
every one of you eaten quite as many strawberries
as I have, only I&#8217;ve a delicate digestion, and can&#8217;t
stand them like you can. You&#8217;re a set of ostriches!
I believe you&#8217;d munch turnips if you were sent to
hoe them! I don&#8217;t mind what you say. So there!&#8221;</p>
<p>As half-past six drew on, and most of the workers
were handing in their last baskets for the day,
Raymonde and Aveline kept watchful eyes on Mrs.
Vernon. They fully expected that she might disappear
on the way back to the camp, so, without
making their purpose apparent, they shadowed her,
pretending that they were looking for flowers in the
hedge. They hung about in the vicinity of her tent
until supper-time, and changed their seats at table so
that they might sit nearer to her in the marquee.
When the meal was over, and the washing up and
water carrying finished, nearly everybody collected
for an amateur concert. Miss Hoyle had a banjo,
which she played atrociously out of tune, but on
which she nevertheless strummed accompaniments
while the rest roared out &#8220;Little Grey Home in the
West,&#8221; &#8220;The Long, Long Trail,&#8221; and other
popular songs. It was certainly not classical music,
but it was amusing; and, as everybody joined in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
choruses, the company consisted entirely of performers,
with no audience except the cows in the
adjacent pasture. Even Mrs. Vernon was singing,
though with an inscrutable look in her grey eyes
hardly suggestive of enjoyment.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s doing it as a blind!&#8221; whispered Raymonde
to Aveline. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let her out of your
sight for a single moment!&#8221;</p>
<p>When the fun was at its height, and everybody
seemed fully occupied with ragtimes, two pairs of
watchful eyes noticed Mrs. Vernon slip quietly
away in the direction of her tent. She went inside
for a moment, then, coming out again with a parcel
in her hand, walked rapidly towards a stile that
led into the fields. Raymonde and Aveline allowed
her to reach the other side of it, then flew like the
wind to a gap in the hedge through which they
could see into the next meadow. She was walking
along the path among the hay, in the direction of
the wood, and was no doubt congratulating herself
upon getting rid of her camp-mates so easily.
There was nothing at all unusual in the fact of her
taking a stroll; many of the workers did so in the
evenings, though they generally went two or three
together. Had it not been for the letter she had
read at the post office, Raymonde&#8217;s suspicions
would probably never have been aroused. The
two girls crossed the stile, and began to follow
Mrs. Vernon as if they, too, were merely enjoying
an ordinary walk, leaving a considerable distance
between her and themselves. She turned round
once, but as they were in the shadow of the hedge
she did not see them. It was a more difficult business
to track her through the wood. The light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
was waning fast here, and in her brown costume
she was sometimes almost indistinguishable among
the tree-trunks and bushes. That she was going
to some specially arranged trysting-place they were
certain. Using infinite caution, they followed her.
Towards the middle of the wood she paused, looked
round, and, seeing nobody (for the girls were hidden
behind a tangle of bramble), she stood still and
called softly. There was no answer. She called
again, waited a few moments, and then began to
walk farther on into the wood. She was at a point
where two paths divided, and she chose the one to
the right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ave,&#8221; whispered Raymonde, &#8220;we must spread
ourselves out. She&#8217;s evidently looking for &#8216;Carl&#8217;,
and he may be on the other path. We mustn&#8217;t
miss him. You follow her, and I&#8217;ll take the way to
the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aveline nodded and obeyed. She did not much
relish going alone, but she had a profound respect
for her chum&#8217;s judgment. The path which Raymonde
had chosen was the narrower and more
overgrown. She stole along, listening and watching.
After a few hundred yards she came to an
ancient yew-tree, the trunk of which, worn with
age, was no more than a hollow shell. It would be
perfectly possible for anyone to hide here. An idea
occurred to her, venturesome indeed, but certainly
feasible. Raymonde was not a girl to stop and
consider risks. If an escaped German were in the
wood, it was her duty to her king and country to
try to effect his arrest. All her patriotism rose
within her, and, though her heart thumped rather
loudly, she told herself that she was not afraid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Going into the middle of the path, she called as
Mrs. Vernon had done, then dived into the shelter
of the hollow tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s anywhere near here, that&#8217;ll bring him!&#8221;
she thought.</p>
<p>For a moment all was silence, then came a
crashing among the bushes, and an answering
call. Someone was coming in the direction of the
yew-tree.</p>
<p>Peeping from her hiding-place, Raymonde could
just distinguish a man&#8217;s figure advancing through
the gathering darkness of the wood. Then awful
fear fell upon her. Suppose he were to look inside
the hollow tree and find her? He was a German,
and a desperate man; she was a girl, and alone.
Why, oh why had she sent Aveline away? He
would be quite capable of murdering her.</p>
<p>In that moment of agony she bitterly repented
her folly. To be sure, there were the gipsies, but
she was not certain whether they were really within
call, and would come quickly in answer to her
signal. The footsteps drew nearer, they were
almost at the tree; she shrank to the farthest
corner, trusting that in the darkness her brown
serge school costume might escape notice. Just
at that moment another cautious shout sounded
through the wood. The footsteps stopped, so near
to her tree that Raymonde could see the flap of a
coat through the opening; then they turned, and
went in the direction of the voice. Raymonde
drew a long breath of intense relief, and peeped
out. The man was tacking down a little incline
towards the brook, guided by a further call.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen he&#8217;s here, and I know he&#8217;s going
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
down there to meet her,&#8221; thought Raymonde.
&#8220;It&#8217;s time for me to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>She slipped from the tree, ran nearer to the edge
of the wood, and gave the peculiar blackbird-like
whistle which the Romany woman had taught her.
Its effect was immediate. Within ten seconds one
of the gipsy boys ran up to her, and she told him
briefly what had occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pass the signal on,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a ring of us all round the wood. We won&#8217;t let him
go, you bet!&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave a low cry like the hooting of an owl,
which was at once answered from the right and the
left.</p>
<p>&#8220;That means &#8216;close the ring&#8217;,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve all sorts of calls that we understand and
talk to each other by when we&#8217;re in the woods.
They&#8217;ll all be moving on now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gipsy boy went forward, and Raymonde,
with her heart again thumping wildly, followed at
a little distance. This was indeed an adventure.
She wondered where Aveline was, and if she were
equally frightened. She wished she had not left
her friend alone.</p>
<p>The gipsies, well versed in wood-craft, walked as
silently as hunters stalking a buck. She would
not have known they were within a mile of her, had
she not been told. Her boy guide had vanished
temporarily among the bushes. She stood still for
a few minutes, uncertain what to do.</p>
<p>Then there was a shout, and a sound of running
footsteps crashing through the bushes, excited
voices called, and presently between the trees came
five or six of the gipsies hauling a man whose arms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
they had already bound with a rope. The Romany
woman, herself as strong as any man, was helping
with apparent gusto. When she saw Raymonde
she ran to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got him right enough, lady!&#8221; she exclaimed
triumphantly. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to take
him to the farm, and borrow a trap to take him to
the jail at Ledcombe. We nabbed him by the
brook as neat as anything. The other young lady&#8217;s
over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aveline! Aveline!&#8221; called Raymonde, rushing
in pursuit of her friend.</p>
<p>The two girls clung to each other eagerly. They
were both thoroughly frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to the camp,&#8221; gasped Aveline.
&#8220;I daren&#8217;t stay here any longer. Oh! I was
terrified when you left me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of Mrs. Vernon?&#8221; asked Raymonde.</p>
<p>Aveline did not know. In the hullabaloo of the
pursuit the woman had been allowed to escape.
She had the wisdom not to return to the camp, and
was indeed never seen again in the neighbourhood.
Great was the excitement at the farm when the
gipsies brought in the German. Mr. Rivers himself
undertook to drive them and their prisoner to
the jail.</p>
<p>Raymonde and Aveline had a thrilling story to
tell in the marquee that night, where everybody
collected to hear the wonderful experience, those
who had already gone to their tents donning dressing-gowns
and coming to join the interested
audience. Miss Gibbs seemed divided between a
sense of her duty as a schoolmistress to scold her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
pupils for undertaking such an extremely wild proceeding,
and a glow of pride that her girls had
actually succeeded in effecting the capture of an
escaped enemy. On the whole, pride and patriotism
prevailed, and the pair were let off with only
a caution against madcap adventures.</p>
<p>Raymonde found herself the idol of the gipsies at
the strawberry gardens next day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re to have a big reward, lady, for copping
that German!&#8221; said the Romany woman. &#8220;It&#8217;ll
buy us a new horse for our caravan. Will you
please accept this basket from us? We wish we&#8217;d
anything better to offer you. I&#8217;ll teach you three
words of Romany&mdash;let me whisper! Don&#8217;t you
forget them, and if you&#8217;re ever in trouble, and want
help from the gipsies, you&#8217;ve only to say those
words to them, and they&#8217;ll give their last drop of
blood for you. But don&#8217;t tell anybody else, lady;
the words are only for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was she saying to you?&#8221; asked Morvyth
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; replied Raymonde. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
secret!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>Camp Hospitality</h3>
</div>
<p>The brief visit at the camp was vanishing with
almost incredible rapidity; the week would finish
on Saturday, but Miss Gibbs had decided to stay
till Monday morning, so as to put in the full period
of work on Saturday afternoon. Sunday was of
course a holiday, and the pickers enjoyed a well-earned
rest. Those who liked went to the little
church in Shipley village, the clergyman of which
also held an outdoor service in the stackyard at the
farm for all whom he could persuade to come.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the members of the camp gave
themselves up to hospitality. They had small and
select private tea-parties, and invited each other, the
hostesses generally being &#8220;at home&#8221; in some cosy
spot beneath a tree, or under the shelter of a hedge,
where the alfresco repast was spread forth, each
guest bringing her own mug and plate. Raymonde,
Morvyth, Katherine, and Aveline were the recipients
of a very special invitation, and Miss Gibbs
assenting, they accepted it with glee. Miss Lowe,
the artist with whom they had struck up a friendship,
had removed on Friday from the camp to
lodgings at an old farm near the village, and she
had asked her four school-girl acquaintances to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
come for early dinner and tea, so that they might
spend the afternoon with her.</p>
<p>Miss Lowe was an interesting personality. She
sketched beautifully, and had shown the girls a
few charming specimens of her work. She had
been painting in the neighbourhood for some weeks
before the strawberry picking began, and had many
quaint accounts to give of her experiences. Her
quarters in the village had been decidedly uncomfortable,
and it seemed very uncertain whether the
rooms she had engaged at the farm would turn out
to be any improvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to take pot-luck if you come to
dinner with me,&#8221; she announced to her guests. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe my landlady has even the most elementary
notions of cooking. The meal will probably
be a surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t mind that!&#8221; the girls assured her.</p>
<p>Miss Lowe had chosen her lodgings more for the
sake of the picturesque than for creature comforts.
The farm-house was an extremely ancient building,
and its very dilapidation rendered it a more suitable
subject for her brush. It consisted of a front later-date
portion, and a much older part at the back,
the two being really separate blocks, connected by
a large central hall. This hall, which measured
about twenty feet square and thirty feet in height,
must at one time have belonged to a family of some
pretensions. The walls to a height of fifteen feet
were covered with splendid oak panelling, grey
with neglect, and above that were ornamented with
plaster designs in bas-relief&mdash;lions, unicorns, wild
boars, stags, and other heraldic devices, a form of
decoration which was also continued over the ceiling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
The back part of the house was evidently the
older; the same beautiful plaster-work was to be
seen, both in the bedrooms and kitchen, together
with fine black oak beams. There was a winding
stair to the upper story, with narrow windows that
suggested a castle, and that dull, dim, soft yellow-brown
light about everything which only seems
reflected from ancient walls. The front portion
consisted of two great sitting-rooms, one of which
was empty, while the other had been arranged for
the accommodation of visitors. Neither walls nor
window-sills had been touched with paint for half
a century, and they were sadly in need of attention.
The house was the property of an old miser,
who refused to spend a penny on repairs, and every
year things went on from bad to worse. The woodwork
of the wide old staircase was rotting away,
most of the doors were off their hinges, and the
rain came through several spots in the roof. Like
many another fine mansion, it had descended from
hall to farm-house, and showed now but faded
relics of its former grandeur.</p>
<p>The farmer and his family lived entirely in the
back premises, and the whole of the front was given
up to their lodgers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t like to sleep here alone,&#8221; said
Morvyth, as Miss Lowe acted cicerone and showed
them through the house. &#8220;These long, gloomy,
eerie corridors give me the shivers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt the same,&#8221; admitted their friend, &#8220;so I
persuaded Miss Barton to join me. She&#8217;s as mad
on the antique as I am, and together we enjoy
ourselves immensely, though we should each feel
spooky alone. Our first business last night was to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
turn five bats out of our bedroom. There&#8217;s an open
trap-door in the ceiling of the landing, and a whole
colony of them seem to be established up there;
they flit up and down the stairs at dusk! One has
to sacrifice comfort to the picturesque. I think I
begin to have just a glimmer of an understanding
why some people prefer new houses to old!&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Miss Lowe and Miss Barton certainly found
their romantic proclivities came into collision with
their preconceived ideas of the fitness of things.
Mrs. Marsden, their landlady, was a kind soul who
did her best; but she had all her farm work and
a large family of children to cope with, so it was
small wonder that cobwebs hung in the passages
and the dust lay thick and untouched. It is sometimes
wiser not to see behind the scenes in country
rooms. Miss Barton had set up her easel in the
great hall, and absolutely revelled in painting the
grey oak and plaster-work, nevertheless she had a
tale of woe to unfold.</p>
<p>&#8220;They use the place as a dairy,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;and they keep the milk in large, uncovered
earthenware pots. First I found the cat was lapping
away at it, and I jumped up and scared it off;
and then the dog strayed in and began to help
itself, and I had to rush again and chase it away.
Then the unwashed baby, still in its dirty little
night-gown, brought a mug and kept dipping it
into the pot to get drinks. We&#8217;re going to take
a jug into the field at milking-time this afternoon,
and ensure our particular portion straight from the
cow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear it,&#8221; said Morvyth, looking
considerably relieved.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s as well we don&#8217;t see most foodstuffs
in the making,&#8221; moralized Aveline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Decidedly! Isn&#8217;t there a story of a barrel of
treacle, and a little nigger baby being found at the
bottom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And an attendant who fell by mistake into the
sausage machine,&#8221; added Miss Lowe, laughing.
&#8220;I suppose one ought to be judiciously blind if
one is to preserve one&#8217;s peace of mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One may shut one&#8217;s eyes, but one can&#8217;t do away
with one&#8217;s nose!&#8221; persisted Miss Barton. &#8220;There
was the most horrible and peculiar and objectionable
odour in the hall yesterday morning, all the
time I was painting. I came to the conclusion that
a rat must have died recently behind the panelling.
Then Mrs. Marsden came in with some milk-cans,
and she raised a lid from a big pot close to where
I was sitting. What do you think was inside?
Twelve pounds of beef that she had put down to
pickle! I hinted that it was rather high, but she
didn&#8217;t seem to perceive it in the least. She can&#8217;t
have the slightest vestige of a nose!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, like some tribes of Africans, she prefers
her meat gamey. Don&#8217;t look so alarmed, you
poor girls, it&#8217;s not going to appear on our table
for dinner! I ordered a fowl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which was alive only a couple of hours ago,
for I saw the children assisting to chase it wildly
round the yard and catch it!&#8221; put in Miss Barton.
&#8220;We warned you, when we invited you, not to
expect too much!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marsden&#8217;s training in the domestic arts
had evidently been defective, and her cooking was
decidedly eccentric. The fowl turned up at table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
plucked, certainly, but looking very pale and
an&aelig;mic with its long untrussed legs sticking helplessly
out before it. It was such an absurd object
that as soon as the landlady had departed from the
room the company exploded.</p>
<p>&#8220;How am I to carve the wretched thing?&#8221;
shrieked Miss Lowe. &#8220;I hardly know where its
wings are! I&#8217;ve never before seen a chicken served
absolutely <i>au naturel</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect it to rise up and walk!&#8221; hinnied Miss
Barton. &#8220;It seems hardly decent to have left its
claws on! Look at the sauce! It&#8217;s simply bread
and milk! Oh, for the fleshpots of Egypt!&#8221;</p>
<p>A ground-rice pudding which followed proved
equally astonishing. Miss Lowe had suggested
that an egg would be an improvement in its composition,
and behold! when it made its appearance
there was an egg neatly poached in the middle.
The giggling guests rather enjoyed the episode
than otherwise. They had come to be entertained,
and they certainly found plenty to amuse them,
especially in the humorous attitude with which
their hostesses viewed all the little inconveniences.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we shall do better at tea-time,&#8221; said
Miss Barton hopefully. &#8220;Mrs. Marsden surely
can&#8217;t go very wrong there. We&#8217;re going to walk
to the woods this afternoon. I&#8217;ve bespoken Jenny,
the fourth child, as a guide. She&#8217;s the most
quaintly fascinating person. I hope she won&#8217;t be
long; we&#8217;re waiting for her now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls were all impatience to start for the
woods, so, as their little guide was already late,
Miss Barton went to the kitchen in search of her,
and found her concluding a somewhat lengthy toilet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
with the assistance of her family. The choicest
possessions of several members, in assorted sizes,
seemed to have been commandeered, and she was
finally turned out in a red serge dress, a black
jacket much too large, a feather boa, and a pair of
woollen gloves, which, considering that it was quite
a hot day, was rank cruelty, though&mdash;true daughter
of Eve as she was&mdash;she seemed so pleased with
her appearance that nothing would induce her to
pull off her suffocating grandeur. She was not
at all shy, and very old-fashioned for her seven
years. The girls found her conversation most entertaining
as they walked along.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is absolutely refreshing!&#8221; giggled Raymonde.
&#8220;The way she shakes out her skirts and
man&oelig;uvres the sleeves of the big jacket is perfectly
lovely. She ought to be a mannikin when she
grows up, and try on coats and mantles in shops.
Wouldn&#8217;t she just enjoy it?&#8221;</p>
<p>To Jenny an expedition with six ladies was
apparently the opportunity of a lifetime, and she
was determined to make the most of it. She volunteered
to recite, and wound out a long poem in such
a rapid, breathless monotone that it was hardly
possible to distinguish a word. The party politely
expressed gratitude, whereupon she announced:
&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it for you again!&#8221; and plunged at once
into an encore.</p>
<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake stop her! I&#8217;m getting hysterical!&#8221;
gurgled Morvyth. &#8220;She&#8217;s like a gramophone
record that&#8217;s rather blurred and has been set too
fast. Thank goodness, here&#8217;s the wood! She can&#8217;t
recite while she&#8217;s climbing that stile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Everybody decided that the wood was worth the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
walk. They spent a delicious afternoon lying
under the tall straight pines, with the sweet-smelling
needles for a bed, watching the delicate and
illusive effects of light filtering among the shimmering
leaves of birches.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I ought to be picking something!&#8221;
laughed Katherine, throwing pine cones at Raymonde.
&#8220;If I live to be a hundred, I&#8217;ll never
forget this strawberry-gathering business. One got
to do it automatically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the story, don&#8217;t you, of the old man
who described himself in the census as a picker?&#8221;
said Miss Barton. &#8220;When he was asked to explain,
he said: &#8216;Well, in June I picks strawberries, and
then I picks beans, and then I picks hops, then
when them&#8217;s over I picks pockets, and then I gets
copped and sent to quod, and picks oakum!&#8217; I
shouldn&#8217;t wonder if some of your gipsy friends,
Raymonde, could boast of a similar record.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care&mdash;they&#8217;re top-hole!&#8221; declared Raymonde,
sticking up for the tribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wants tea?&#8221; said Miss Lowe. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
asked Miss Nelson and Miss Porter from the camp,
and if we don&#8217;t hurry back at once, we shall find
them waiting for us when we return, and slanging
us for being rude. Come along!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Lowe had casually informed Mrs. Marsden
that she expected a few friends to tea, but had not
mentioned anything about special preparation,
thinking that they would carry the cups and
saucers into the garden, and have it under the
trees. Little did they know the surprise their
enterprising landlady had in store for them. When
they arrived at the farm they found her, dressed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
her best attire, waiting at the door to receive them,
and she proudly ushered them into the sitting-room,
where she had spread forth a meal such as
might be set before a particularly hungry assemblage
of Sunday School scholars.</p>
<p>A large ham, not yet quite cold, adorned one end
of the table, and a big apple-pie the other, while
down the centre were seven round jam-tarts, each
measuring about seven inches in diameter. The
cruets had been put in the middle of the table
instead of Miss Barton&#8217;s bowl of flowers, and there
were several substantial platefuls of currant-bread.
It was an extremely warm afternoon, and even to
school-girl appetites the sight of such plenty at
4 p.m. was appalling. Miss Lowe&#8217;s convulsed
apologies sent the visitors into explosions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the tarts!&#8221; choked Miss Barton.
&#8220;They&#8217;re all made with black-currant jam! There&#8217;s
one apiece for us, counting the apple-pie. And
the currant-bread is half an inch thick! Who&#8217;ll
take a slice of lukewarm ham? Oh, it&#8217;s positively
painful to laugh so hard! I never saw such a
bean-feast in my life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly can&#8217;t consume all these!&#8221; echoed
Miss Lowe. &#8220;The children must eat up some of
them for supper. It will take days to get through
such a larderful! For once they&#8217;ll be satiated with
jam-tarts. Well, I suppose it&#8217;s an ill wind that
blows nobody good. Still, if the baby comes to an
untimely end through acute dyspepsia, I shan&#8217;t be
in the least surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Marsden seemed determined to entertain
her guests, and had yet another surprise in store
for them. She beckoned them into a little private
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
parlour of her own, and showed them the paintings
of her eldest boy, a youth of eighteen, who, she
proudly assured them, had never had a drawing
lesson in his life. It was not difficult to believe
her, for the specimens were so funny that the
spectators could hardly keep their faces straight.
Horses with about as much shape as those in a
child&#8217;s Noah&#8217;s ark, figures resembling Dutch dolls
in rigidity, flowers daubed on with the crudest
colours, and the final effort, a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the
village, consisting chiefly of tiled roofs and chimney-pots
in lurid red and black.</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt it has afforded him the supremest
delight,&#8221; whispered Miss Lowe to Miss Barton,
&#8220;and it&#8217;s evidently a subject of the utmost satisfaction
to his mother, so I won&#8217;t make carping criticisms,
but take it as a moral for the necessity of due
humility over one&#8217;s own productions. Perhaps
mine would be as diverting to an Academician as
his are to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the same room Mrs. Marsden showed her
visitors a mysterious oil-painting, black with age
and hideous beyond compare, which she informed
them was an original portrait of Nell Gwynn. She
supposed it to be immensely valuable, and was keeping
it safe until prices rose a little higher still, after
the war, when she had hopes of launching it on the
auction rooms in London, and realizing a sum that
would make her family&#8217;s fortune.</p>
<p>&#8220;An ambition she&#8217;ll never realize in this wide
world,&#8221; said Miss Barton afterwards, &#8220;for the
thing is absolutely not genuine. It&#8217;s not the right
period for Nell Gwynn, and it&#8217;s so atrociously badly
painted that it&#8217;s obviously the work of some village
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
artist. She&#8217;s in for a big disappointment some
day, poor woman! I hadn&#8217;t the heart to squash
her, when she seemed so proud of it&mdash;especially as
she was still a little huffy that we hadn&#8217;t consumed
her black-currant tarts!&#8221;</p>
<p>Though physically they were rather weary, the
girls were sorry when their week&#8217;s strawberry
picking came to an end. It was found that when their
canteen bills had been paid, and railway fares subtracted,
they had each earned on an average a
little over five shillings; some who were quicker
pickers exceeding that amount, and others falling
below. They decided to pool the general proceeds,
and present the sum cleared&mdash;&pound;4, 16<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>.&mdash;to the
Hospital for Disabled Soldiers as their &#8220;bit&#8221;
towards their country. They went back to school
feeling highly patriotic, and burning to boast of
their experiences to those slackers who had chosen
the parental roof for their holidays.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have loved it!&#8221; protested Fauvette, &#8220;but
I really did have a very nice time at home. My
cousin was back on leave. He&#8217;s in the Flying
Corps, and he&#8217;s six feet three in his stockings&mdash;and&mdash;well&mdash;I&#8217;ve
got his photo upstairs, if you&#8217;d
like to look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re all accustomed to gipsies and poachers
now, and don&#8217;t think anything of airmen!&#8221; returned
Morvyth nonchalantly (she was apt to sit on
Fauvette). &#8220;You should see my snapshots of the
strawberry pickers!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And mine!&#8221; broke in Cynthia Greene. &#8220;By
the by, I wrote my name and school address on a
card, and packed it inside one of my strawberry
baskets. I put on it: &#8216;Will the finder kindly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
write to a blue-eyed, fair-haired girl who feels
lonely?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cynthia, you didn&#8217;t!&#8221; exploded the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did&mdash;crystal! Why shouldn&#8217;t I? Lonely
soldiers beg for letters, and it&#8217;s as lonely at school
as in barracks any day, at least I find it so!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose somebody takes you at your word and
sends an answer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heartily and sincerely hope somebody will.
It would be absolutely topping!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>Concerns Cynthia</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Look here!&#8221; said Hermie to Raymonde two
days later, when the latter was helping the monitress
to put away the wood-carving tools; &#8220;what&#8217;s
the matter with Cynthia Greene? She&#8217;s behaving
in the most idiotic fashion&mdash;goes mincing about
the school, and sighing, and even mopping her
eyes when she thinks anybody&#8217;s looking at her.
What&#8217;s she posing about now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She says she feels lonely&mdash;and fair-haired and
blue-eyed&mdash;at least that&#8217;s what she wrote inside her
strawberry basket,&#8221; volunteered Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the name of the Muses do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde explained. The monitress listened
aghast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I call that the limit!&#8221; she exploded.
&#8220;The little monkey! Why, Gibbie would slay
her if she knew! Such an atrociously cheeky, unladylike
thing to do, and putting her address here
at the Grange! Bringing discredit on the school!
I don&#8217;t suppose whoever finds it will take any
notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s hoping for an answer,&#8221; said Raymonde.
&#8220;I believe she&#8217;s just yearning to be mixed up in
a love affair.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At thirteen!&#8221; scoffed Hermie. &#8220;The silly
young blighter! I&#8217;d like to shake her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do, she&#8217;ll be rather pleased than otherwise,&#8221;
returned Raymonde. &#8220;She&#8217;ll pose as a
martyr then, and say the world is unsympathetic.
I&#8217;m beginning to know Cynthia Greene.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re right!&#8221; said the monitress
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Sentiment was not encouraged at the Grange.
Miss Beasley very rightly thought that girls should
keep their childhood as long as possible, and
that premature love affairs wiped the bloom off
genuine later experiences. The school in general
assumed the attitude of scoffing at romance, except
in the pages of the library books. It was not considered
good form to allude to it. Tennis or hockey
was a more popular topic.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Cynthia&#8217;s trying to run the sentimental
business,&#8221; mused Hermie. &#8220;It&#8217;ll spread if we
don&#8217;t take care. It&#8217;s as infectious as measles. I&#8217;m
not going to have all those juniors wandering
about the garden, reading poetry instead of practising
their cricket&mdash;it&#8217;s not good enough. Yet it&#8217;s
difficult for a monitress to interfere. As you say,
Cynthia would take a melancholy pride in being
persecuted. Look here, Raymonde, you&#8217;re a young
blighter yourself sometimes, but you don&#8217;t go in
for this kind of rubbish. Can&#8217;t you think of some
plan to nip the thing in the bud before it goes
further? You&#8217;re generally inventive enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I might have a free hand for a day or two,
I might manage something,&#8221; admitted Raymonde
with caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d tell the other monitresses to let you alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
I don&#8217;t mind how you contrive it, as long as you
knock the nonsense out of the juniors. Cynthia
Greene of all people, too! The former ornament
of The Poplars, who used to keep up the tone (so
she says) and set an example to the rest. What
is she coming to? I should think they&#8217;d want that
bracelet back, if they knew!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mystic Seven had a special Committee Meeting
before tea, and pledged one another to utmost
secrecy. The result of their confabulations seemed
satisfactory to themselves, for they parted chuckling.</p>
<p>The next morning, when Cynthia Greene went
to her desk to take out a lesson book, she found
inside a letter addressed to herself. She opened
it in a whirl of excitement. It was written in a
slanting, backward kind of hand, with a very thick
pen. Its contents ran thus:</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Dear Miss Cynthia</span>,</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; '>&#8220;Being the fortunate recipient of the card
placed in a strawberry basket, and bearing your
name, I am venturing to answer it. I, too, am
lonely, and long for friendship. I admire blue
eyes and fair hair; I myself am dark. I should
like immensely to meet you. Could you possibly
be at the side gate of your garden shortly after
seven this evening? I shall arrive by motor, and
walk past on the chance of seeing you.</p>
<p style='margin-left:1.0em; margin-right:1.0em; text-align:right'><span style='margin-right: 3.125em;'>&#8220;Yours respectfully but devotedly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-right: 1.0em;'>&#8220;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Algernon Augustus Fitzmaurice.</span>&#8221;</span><br /></p>
<p>The conduct of Cynthia during the course of the
day was extraordinary. She exhibited a mixture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
of self-importance and fluttering anticipation that
was highly puzzling to her companions. She refused
to explain, but dropped sufficient hints to
arouse interest. It was presently whispered among
the juniors that Cynthia had received a love-letter
from somebody highly distinguished and aristocratic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it come by post?&#8221; asked Joan Butler.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course not. Gibbie would never have
given it to her if it had. Cynthia found it inside
her desk. She doesn&#8217;t know who put it there. It&#8217;s
most mysterious.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the day, Cynthia was a heroine of romance
among her Form. She played the part admirably,
wearing an abstracted expression in her blue eyes,
and starting when spoken to, as if aroused from daydreams.
She mentioned casually that she believed
the family of Fitzmaurice to be an extremely ancient
one, and that its members were mentioned in the
<i>Peerage</i>. As there was no copy of that volume in
the school library, nobody could contradict her, and
her audience murmured interested acquiescence.
When asked whether they preferred the name of
Algernon or Augustus, their opinions were divided.</p>
<p>At first the juniors were sympathetic, but by the
end of the afternoon the goddess of envy began to
rear her head in their midst. Cynthia&#8217;s manner
had progressed during the day to a point of patronage
that was distinctly aggravating. She openly
pitied girls who did not receive private letters, and
spoke of early engagements as highly desirable.
She missed two catches when fielding at cricket,
being employed in staring sentimentally at the sky
instead of watching for the ball.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Buck up, you silly idiot, can&#8217;t you? You&#8217;re
a disgrace to the school!&#8221; snarled Nora Fawcitt
furiously.</p>
<p>Cynthia sighed gently, with the air of &#8220;Ah-if-you-only-knew-my-feelings!&#8221;
and twisted the ends
of her hair into ringlets. After tea, in defiance of
all school traditions, she changed her dress and put
on her best slippers. She appeared in the schoolroom
with a bunch of pansies pinned into her belt.</p>
<p>Preparation was from six to seven, and was
supposed to be a period of strenuous mental application.
That evening, however, Cynthia made
little progress with her Latin exercise or the Wars
of the Roses. Her Form mates, looking up in the
intervals of conning their textbooks, noted her sitting
with idle pen, gazing raptly into space or
glancing anxiously at the clock. Though she had
not confided the details of her secret, her companions
felt that something was going to happen.
Romance was in the atmosphere. Several of the
juniors found themselves wishing that clandestine
letters had appeared in their desks also. When the
signal for dismissal was given, and the girls trooped
from the schoolroom, Cynthia mysteriously melted
away somewhere. Ardiune, walking round the
quad. five minutes later, accosted Joan Butler,
Janet Macpherson, Nancie Page, and Isobel Parker,
who were sitting on the steps of the sundial reading
Ella Wheeler Wilcox&#8217;s <i>Poems of Love</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d like a little sport,&#8221; she observed,
&#8220;come along with me. You may bring Elsie and
Nora if you can find them. I promise you a jinky
time!&#8221;</p>
<p>The juniors rose readily. None of them were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
really very fond of reading, but Cynthia had lent
them the book earlier in the day, with a few pages
turned down for reference. They flung it on to
the stone step, with scant regard for its white cover.
Ardiune led her recruits hastily to the back drive,
and bade them hide behind the thick laurel and
clipped holly bushes that backed the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody you know is coming to keep an
appointment, and will get a surprise,&#8221; she volunteered.</p>
<p>They had hardly taken cover when Cynthia
Greene appeared, strolling along the drive. She
advanced to the gate, leaned her elbow on it, and,
posing picturesquely, glanced with would-be carelessness
up and down the back lane, and coughed.</p>
<p>At this very evident signal a figure emerged
from the shelter of the opposite bushes and strode
to the gate. The juniors gasped. They had all
taken part in last Christmas&#8217;s term-end performance,
and they easily recognized the hat, long coat,
and military moustache of the school theatrical
wardrobe, the only masculine garments permitted
at the Grange. Cynthia, being a new-comer, was
not acquainted with them. Her agitated eyes
merely took in a manly vision who was accosting
her politely, though without removing his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I the pleasure of addressing Miss Cynthia
Greene?&#8221; asked a deep-toned voice.</p>
<p>Cynthia, utterly overcome, giggled a faint assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Algernon Augustus. Delighted to make
your acquaintance! You&#8217;re the very girl I&#8217;ve always
longed to meet. I can&#8217;t describe my loneliness,
and how I&#8217;m yearning for sympathy. Fairest, loveliest
one, will you smile upon me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>What Cynthia might have answered it is impossible
to guess, but at that critical moment the
hat, which was several sizes too large, tilted to
one side, and allowed Raymonde&#8217;s hair to escape
down her back. Cynthia&#8217;s agitated shriek brought
a crowd of witnesses from out the laurel bushes.
They did not spare their victim, and a perfect storm
of chaff descended upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it go to meet its ownest own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you call him Algernon, or Augustus?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he tell you his family pedigree?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s his motor-car, please?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the engagement announced yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re a set of beasts!&#8221; whimpered
Cynthia, leaning her head against the gate and
sobbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t been such a silly idiot you
wouldn&#8217;t have been taken in by such a transparent
business,&#8221; returned Raymonde, pulling off
her moustache. &#8220;Look here, we don&#8217;t care about
this sickly sort of stuff, so the sooner you drop it
the better. Gracious, girl! Turn off the waterworks!
Be thankful Gibbie didn&#8217;t scent out your romance,
that&#8217;s all! If the Bumble knew you&#8217;d put that card
inside that strawberry basket, she&#8217;d pack up your
boxes and send you home by the next train. Crystal
clear, she would!&#8221;</p>
<p>For at least a week after this, Cynthia Greene
suffered a chastened life, and shed enough tears
to make her pocket-handkerchiefs a conspicuous
item in her laundry bag. She began to wish that
the names of Augustus and Algernon could be
expunged from the English language. Her Form
mates hinted that she might receive a present of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Debrett&#8217;s <i>Peerage</i> on her next birthday. If she
missed a ball at tennis, or slacked a little at cricket,
somebody was sure to enquire: &#8220;Thinking of him?&#8221;
She found a picture of two turtle-doves attached to
the pin-cushion on her dressing-table, and drawings
of hearts and darts were scrawled by unknown
hands inside her textbooks. Moreover, she lived
in constant dread lest somebody should have really
found the card inside the strawberry basket, and
should send an answer by post, which would fall
into the hands of Miss Beasley. The prospect of
expulsion from the school haunted her.</p>
<p>Fortunately for her, nobody troubled to notice
her request for correspondence, the basket of strawberries
having probably found its way to some
snuffy individual at a greengrocer&#8217;s stall, who took
no interest in the loneliness of blue-eyed, fair-haired
damsels. As for her volume of <i>Poems of Love</i>,
Hermie confiscated it until the end of the term, and
recommended a <i>Manual of Cricket</i> instead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>On the River</h3>
</div>
<p>Miss Gibbs was fast arriving at the disappointing
conclusion that patriotism costs dearly: in other
words, that if you take away eighteen girls to do
strawberry picking, you cannot expect them, immediately
on their return, to settle down again into
ordinary routine and everyday habits. An atmosphere
of camp life seemed to pervade the place,
a free-and-easy, rollicking spirit that was not at all
in accordance with Miss Beasley&#8217;s ideas of propriety.
The Principal, who had never altogether
approved of the week on the land, considered that
the school was demoralized, and made a firm effort
to restore discipline. The monitresses, several of
whom had been guilty of whistling in the passages,
were summoned separately for private interviews in
the study, whence they issued somewhat subdued
and abashed; and the rank and file, by means of
punishment lessons and fines, were made to feel a
wholesome respect for the iron hand of the law.</p>
<p>Miss Beasley and Miss Gibbs agreed that the
Fifth Form gave the largest amount of trouble. It
was here that most of the mischief fermented and
fizzed out on unexpected occasions. At present the
Mystic Seven, who beforetime had offered a united
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
front to the world, were suffering from a series of
internal quarrels. The four who had been to camp
assumed an air of superiority over the three who
had not, which led to unpleasantness. Naturally it
was annoying to Ardiune, Valentine, and Fauvette
to hear constant allusions to people they had not
met, and to thrilling experiences in which they had
not participated. They sulked or flew out as the
occasion might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re just making up half the things
to stuff us!&#8221; sneered Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed we&#8217;re not!&#8221; flared Morvyth. &#8220;Every
word we&#8217;ve told you is gospel truth, as you&#8217;d have
found out if you&#8217;d come and done your bit for your
country!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you mean to call me a slacker?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not, but it&#8217;s no use ostriching about
things. You either went and picked strawberries,
or you didn&#8217;t&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I wasn&#8217;t allowed to go! You mean
wretch!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know nothing at all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve told you a dozen times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really can&#8217;t listen, child, to all the things you
tell me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I shan&#8217;t take the trouble to speak to you
again!&#8221;</p>
<p>With Ardiune and Morvyth on terms of distant
iciness, Valentine and Katherine constantly sparring
over trifles, Fauvette preserving an attitude
of martyred dignity, and Aveline, out of sheer
perversity, striking up a friendship with Maudie
Heywood, matters were not very brisk in the Fifth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting just about fed up with you all!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
said Raymonde irritably. &#8220;I never saw such a
set! How can we have any fun, when everybody&#8217;s
grousing with everyone else? For goodness&#8217; sake,
buck up! I&#8217;ve a blossomy idea in my head! Yes,
I have, honest!&#8221;</p>
<p>Signs of interest manifested themselves on the
faces of her companions. Raymonde&#8217;s ideas were
always worth listening to. Aveline stopped yawning,
Morvyth desisted from kicking her geography
book round the floor, and Fauvette snapped the
clasp of her bracelet, and sat bolt upright.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hanging upon your words, if you&#8217;ll
condescend to explain, O Queen!&#8221; she vouchsafed.</p>
<p>Raymonde bowed, with heels together and hands
back, like the star of a pierrot troupe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mensh! Glad to do my bit!&#8221; she replied.
&#8220;Well, my notion&#8217;s this. It&#8217;s the Bumble&#8217;s
birthday on Friday!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As if every girl in the school didn&#8217;t know that!&#8221;
chafed Ardiune impatiently. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t we all
given our shillings towards her present ages ago?
Really, Ray, what more chestnuts are you going
to bring forth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be in such a hurry, my good child!
I haven&#8217;t finished yet. I should have thought you
could have trusted your grannie by this time. My
remark, though no doubt stale, was only one of
those preliminary announcements with which a
chairman always has to begin&mdash;like &#8216;Glad to see
so many bright young faces collected here&#8217;, or
&#8216;Gratified to be allowed the pleasure of saying a
few words to you&#8217;. But don&#8217;t look so scared, I&#8217;m
not going to prose on like a real chairman at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
prize-giving; I&#8217;m going to get to the point quick.
Being the Bumble&#8217;s birthday&mdash;if you grin, Ardiune
Coleman-Smith, I&#8217;ll pinch you!&mdash;Being, as I have
observed, the Bumble&#8217;s birthday, it seems only right
and fit and proper that the other bees in the hive
should buzz in sympathy, and take a holiday, and
go and sip nectar. Let us copy Nature&#8217;s methods!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Copy Nature, by all means,&#8221; sneered Ardiune,
&#8220;only don&#8217;t suggest that bumble-bees live in hives,
or you&#8217;ll be a little out of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re so literal! It&#8217;s only for the sake of
the metaphor. Mayn&#8217;t I talk about &#8216;the busy bee&#8217;
and &#8216;the shining hour&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For pity&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t get flowery!&#8221; snapped
Morvyth.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;&#8216;How doth the little busy bee<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>Delight to bark and bite;</span><br />
She gathers honey all the day,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 0.78125em;'>And eats it up at night!&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>misquoted Aveline with a giggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop frivolling, and let me get to my point!&#8221;
commanded Raymonde. &#8220;For the third time, let
me remind you that it is the Bumble&#8217;s birthday on
Friday, and that it&#8217;s only decent and seemly and
becoming that the school should do something to
celebrate so joyous an occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop a minute!&#8221; interrupted Katherine. &#8220;Are
we rejoicing that she came into this world to
gladden us, or are we counting one more year off
towards the time when we&#8217;ll have done with her?
I&#8217;m not quite clear which.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whichever you like, so long as you look congratulatory
and happy-in-our-school-days and love-our-teachers,
and all the rest of it. What you
want is to spread the butter on thick, then, when
there&#8217;s an atmosphere of smiles, ask for a holiday
and suggest the river. Yes, my children, I said
the river. You didn&#8217;t misunderstand me; I speak
quite clearly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew! She&#8217;ll never let us! Might as well
ask for the moon. Why, our river expedition was
knocked off after that little business of the Zepp
scare!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the more reason why we should have it
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ray, you&#8217;re the limit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope I am, if it means getting what we want.
I propose a deputation to the Bumble, to state
that the gratitude and devotion of the hive can only
work itself off on water. Yes, Ardiune Coleman-Smith,
I did say &#8216;the hive&#8217;, my sense of poetry
being more highly developed than my love of exact
science. You needn&#8217;t lift your eyebrows, it&#8217;s not
a pretty habit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to make the deputation?&#8221; asked
Fauvette.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, for one. You&#8217;re our strongest point.
You look naturally affectionate and clinging and
docile, and ready-to-be-taught-if-taken-the-right-way,
and easily led, and all the rest of it. You&#8217;ll
burble forth something pretty about wanting to
have an expedition with our Principal in our midst,
and mention what a wet day it was last year, and
how disappointed we all were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, I&#8217;m not going to do all the talking,
so don&#8217;t think!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll support you! But I&#8217;m just giving
you a few leading lines to work upon. We&#8217;ll take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Maudie Heywood with us; she got ninety-five
marks out of a hundred last week, which ought
to go for something!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Magsie and Muriel had better come too.
It won&#8217;t do to let the Bumble think the whole idea
has originated with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are! The more pattern pupils we
can scrape together, the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>At five o&#8217;clock the deputation presented itself at
the door of the study, and was received graciously
by the Principal, though she declined to commit
herself to an immediate answer, promising to think
the matter over and to let them know later on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which means she daren&#8217;t say &#8216;yes&#8217; till she&#8217;s
asked leave from Gibbie!&#8221; declared Raymonde,
when the delegates were out of ear-shot of the
sanctum. &#8220;Fauvette, child, you did splendidly!
I&#8217;d give five thousand pounds to have your big,
pathetic, innocent blue eyes! They always bowl
everybody over. I envy you at your first grown-up
dance. You&#8217;ll have your programme full in five
minutes, like the heroine of a novel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde&#8217;s supposition was not altogether mistaken,
for that evening, after the school had gone
to bed, Miss Beasley, Miss Gibbs, and Mademoiselle
sat up talking over the proposed expedition.
Miss Gibbs vetoed the idea entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The girls have not been behaving well enough
to justify any such indulgence,&#8221; she maintained impressively.
&#8220;Their conduct on the stairs yesterday
was disgraceful. Better make them stick to their
lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle, whose mental scales always tipped
naturally towards the side of pleasure, thought it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
was a beautiful idea of the dear girls to want to
give their headmistress a f&ecirc;te on her anniversary.
So sweet to go upon the water, and while the
weather was so pleasant! It would be an event to
be remembered for ever in their young lives, when
sterner lessons might be forgotten; at which remark
Miss Gibbs sniffed, but restrained herself. Miss
Beasley vibrated for some minutes between the
practical and the ideal aspects thus presented to
her, but finally decided in favour of the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems ungracious to refuse when they wish
it to be my birthday treat,&#8221; she said rather apologetically.
&#8220;The poor children would be so disappointed.
We might make a clear mark-book a
necessary condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Miss Gibbs grudgingly conceded.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll miss their Latin preparation that evening,&#8221;
she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;And their French,&#8221; sighed Mademoiselle.
&#8220;But what will you?&#8221; with a little shrug. &#8220;It is
not every day that our Principal makes a birthday!
As for me, I am glad I bought my new sunshade.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement of the forthcoming water
excursion was received with great rejoicings. Ever
since the beginning of the term the school had
thirsted to go upon the river. They had been
taken for an occasional walk along its banks, and
had greatly envied the young men and maidens
who might be seen punting up its willowy reaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do directly I&#8217;m grown
up!&#8221; Fauvette had confided to her chums. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
buy a white boating costume, exactly like that girl&#8217;s
with the auburn hair, and lean against blue cushions
while <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>He</span> rows. He&#8217;ll have to have brown eyes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
but I&#8217;ve not quite decided yet whether he shall have
a moustache or not. On the whole I think I&#8217;ll have
him clean shaven.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And tall,&#8221; prompted Raymonde, to whom Fauvette&#8217;s
prospective romances were a source of perennial
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, tall, of course, with several military crosses.
He&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m going to like the best, though
there&#8217;ll be others. They&#8217;ll all want me to go and
row with them&mdash;but I shan&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t mean to flirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N&mdash;no!&#8221; conceded Raymonde a little dubiously.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, though, it might be rather good
for him not to let him see you were too keen? Of
course I don&#8217;t want you to break his heart, but&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fauvette shook her yellow curls.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not right to trifle with people&#8217;s hearts,&#8221; she
decided, with all the authority of an experienced
reader of magazine stories. &#8220;If you pretend you
don&#8217;t care for them, they drive their aeroplanes recklessly
and smash up, or expose themselves to the
enemy&#8217;s fire, or get submarined, before you&#8217;ve had
time to tell them you didn&#8217;t really mean to be cold.
I&#8217;m not going in for misunderstandings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde glanced at her admiringly. With
those blue eyes and fluffy curls it all seemed so
possible. She felt that she should look forward to
her chum&#8217;s inevitable engagement almost as much
as Fauvette herself. It would be as good as a
Shakespeare play, or one of the best pieces on the
kinema. But these rosy prospects were still in the
dim and distant future; the present was entirely
prosaic and unromantic. Whatever punting excursions
Fauvette might enjoy in years to come, this
particular water party would be quite unsentimental,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
conducted under the watchful eyes of Miss Beasley
and Miss Gibbs, with boatmen well over military
age to do the rowing. For the first time for four
years the Principal&#8217;s birthday morning was gloriously
fine. The pupils placed the usual bouquet
of flowers opposite her seat at the breakfast table,
together with a handsomely bound volume of Ruskin&#8217;s
<i>Stones of Venice</i>. She thanked them with her
customary surprise and gratitude, and assured them,
as she did annually, what a pleasure it was to her
to receive so kind a token of their esteem.</p>
<p>This preliminary business being over, breakfast
and classes proceeded as usual, a more than ordinary
atmosphere of decorum pervading the establishment,
for Miss Gibbs had announced that the afternoon&#8217;s
excursion depended upon the mark-book,
and the girls knew that she would keep her word.
The veriest slackers paid attention to lessons that
morning, and even Raymonde for once did not
receive an order mark.</p>
<p>Lunch was served early, and directly the meal
was finished all the girls flew upstairs to change
their attire. During hot weather the school was
not kept strictly to the brown serge uniform, and
the girls blossomed out into linen costumes, or
white drill skirts and muslin blouses. For the
credit of the Grange they made careful toilettes that
afternoon; Fauvette in particular looked ravishingly
pretty in a pale-blue sailor suit with a white collar
and silk tie. She made quite a sensation as she
came down the stairs.</p>
<p>The mistresses had also turned out suitably
dressed for the occasion: Miss Beasley was dignified
and matronly in blue voile with a motor veil; Miss
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
Gibbs, who intended to row, was in practical blouse
and short skirt; while Mademoiselle was a dream
of white muslin, chiffon ruffles, and pink parasol.</p>
<p>It was about half an hour&#8217;s walk to the river,
down shady lanes and across lately cleared hayfields.
There was a little landing-place close to
the weir, with a boat-house, a refreshment room,
and rows of benches and tables under the trees,
where visitors could sit and drink tea or lemonade.
Miss Beasley had engaged boats beforehand, and
these were drawn up ready, with their boatmen,
a rheumatic and elderly set, waiting about smoking
surreptitious pipes among the willows. There was
a great deal of arranging before everybody was
settled, and many injunctions to sit still, and not
to change places, or to grab at water-lilies, or lean
too far over the side, or play any other foolish or
dangerous prank likely to upset the equilibrium of
the boat and endanger the lives of its occupants.
At last, however, the whole party was stowed safely
away, and the little procession set off up the river.</p>
<p>All agreed that it was quite delightful. The
banks were covered with trees, and tall reeds, and
masses of purple willow herb, and agrimony, and
yellow ragwort, which were reflected in the dark
waters of quiet pools. In the centre the sunshine
made little gleaming, glinting ripples like leaping
bars of gold, and here and there patches of water-lilies
spread their white chalices open to the sky.
There was a delicious breeze, most grateful after
the hot walk across the hayfields, and the smooth
gliding motion was ideal. The girls trailed their
hands in the river, and dabbed their faces, and said
it was topping, and began to sing boat songs which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
they had learnt at school, and which sounded very
pretty and appropriate to an accompaniment of oars
and lapping water.</p>
<p>The great event of the afternoon was to be a picnic
tea. Hampers of provisions had been brought,
and Miss Beasley proposed that they should land
at one of the numerous little islands, light a fire,
and boil their big kettles. The selection of the particular
island was, of course, in her discretion, and
she had a conference with her old boatman on the
subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Island? I knows of the very one to suit you.
I&#8217;ve taken parties there before, and there&#8217;s a good
spot to land, and a place to tie the boats to, which
there isn&#8217;t on every one of them islands. It&#8217;s just
an hour&#8217;s row up from the weir, and less time to go
back because of the current.&#8221;</p>
<p>After gliding onward for what seemed to the
girls all too short a space of time, but no doubt
appeared considerably longer to their rheumatic
rowers, the island in question was at last reached.
It looked most attractive with the willows and bulrushes
and tangly interior. A tree-stump made
quite a good landing-place, and everyone managed
to scramble out successfully without planting a foot
in the water. The first business was to explore,
and to hunt up sufficient wood for a camp fire.
Luckily the weather had been dry, so that all available
sticks would be suitable for fuel. The girls
dispersed in various directions, on the understanding
that they were to reassemble when Miss Beasley
blew her whistle as a signal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I call this a great stunt!&#8221; observed Morvyth, as
the Mystic Seven moved off in company.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Even Gibbie&#8217;s in spirits, bless her!&#8221; murmured
Aveline fatuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;So she is. But all the same, I&#8217;d rather wander
off alone than be tied to her apron-strings; so come
along, quick! Remember you&#8217;re to earn your living
by picking up sticks, so don&#8217;t slack!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheero, old sport! Don&#8217;t get raggy!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pioneers were penetrating the virgin forest on all
sides. From right and left came squeals, giggles,
or chuckles, as the girls investigated the capacities
of the island. Some kept to the banks and cut dry
reeds to make the bonfire burn quickly, while others
were in quest of more solid fuel.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;d only had a hatchet or a saw,&#8221; sighed
Raymonde, &#8220;we might have cut off some quite
nice logs. There really isn&#8217;t much to pick up on
the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish we could take that rotten tree along with
us,&#8221; murmured Morvyth, pointing to a decayed
old stump that stood upright with two withered
boughs like scraggy arms outstretched on either
side of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too big a job, my child; but we might break
off one of those branches,&#8221; opined Raymonde.
&#8220;No, I know we can&#8217;t reach it from below, that&#8217;s
self-evident. Your humble servant&#8217;s going to
climb. Here, Ave, you bluebottle, give me a
leg up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Suppose it topples over with you! Don&#8217;t,
Ray!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bunkum! It won&#8217;t! I&#8217;m not scared, thanks!&#8221;</p>

&#8220;FAUVETTE IN PARTICULAR LOOKED RAVISHINGLY PRETTY&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>As a matter of fact, Raymonde knew perfectly
well that she was going to perform rather a risky
feat. She did it because she was in a don&#8217;t-care
frame of mind, also because she had quarrelled
with Morvyth earlier in the afternoon, and wished
to astonish her. Morvyth was standing now, elevating
her eyebrows, and looking as if she did not
believe that Raymonde would really carry out her
boast, which was all the more reason for the latter
to put speech into action.</p>
<p>Aveline obediently rendered the required assistance,
and with a swing and a clutch Raymonde
managed to scramble up the trunk to the place
where the boughs forked. One of these was in a
particularly crumbling and decrepit condition, and
she thought that with a strong effort she might
succeed in breaking it off. It was not an easy
matter to balance herself on the fork and stretch
out to pull at the branch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be over in a sec.!&#8221; called Morvyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bow-wow!&#8221; responded Raymonde airily.</p>
<p>She leaned a little farther along, seized the branch
with both hands, and gave a mighty tug. The
result was more than she anticipated. The poor
old tree had reached a stage of such interior decay
that it was really only kept together by the bark.
The violence of the wrench upset it to its foundations;
it tottered, swayed, and suddenly descended.
The girls picked up Raymonde out of a cloud of
dust and a mass of touchwood. By all strict rules
of retribution she ought to have been hurt, but as
a matter of fact she was only a little bruised, considerably
choked with pulverized wood, and very
much astonished. When she recovered her presence
of mind, she set to work to break off pieces
from the boughs, which were just exactly what was
wanted for the bonfire fuel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Gibbie!&#8221; she besought the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o! Mum&#8217;s the word!&#8221; her chums assured
her. &#8220;Bless its little heart, we wouldn&#8217;t get it into
a scrape! Don&#8217;t think it of us!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Beasley&#8217;s signal sounded at this critical
moment, so the Mystic Seven filed off like vestal
virgins to feed the fire which Miss Gibbs, with her
accustomed energy, had already lighted. Their
contribution of wood was so substantial that it
drew comment from the rest of the party, but they
received the congratulations with due modesty, and
did not divulge the source of their supply. Most
of the girls were too much interested in proclaiming
their own adventures to care to listen to anybody
else&#8217;s, and the mistresses were busy watching the
kettles. It seemed like camp life over again to be
sitting in a circle, drinking tea out of enamelled
mugs, and eating thick pieces of bread and butter.
Miss Beasley had provided a large home-made
plum birthday cake, with a sixpence baked in it,
the acquisition of which was naturally a matter of
keen interest to each several girl, until the lucky
slice fell to the lot of Cynthia Greene, who fondled
the coveted coin tenderly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a hole bored through it, and wear it
on my chain always, in memory of you, dear Miss
Beasley!&#8221; she declared in emphatic tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little sycophant!&#8221; sneered Morvyth enviously.</p>
<p>&#8220;She ought to give it to the soldiers!&#8221; snapped
Raymonde.</p>
<p>But Miss Gibbs was rattling a row of mugs together
as a delicate hint that the feast was finished,
and the Principal was consulting her watch, and
calling to the boatmen to make ready. The monitresses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
swept all remaining comestibles into the
baskets, stamped out the fire, emptied the kettles,
and proclaimed the camping-ground left in due
order. One by one the boats started on their way
down the river, drifting easily now with the current,
and leaving long trails of ripples behind
them. The sun was sinking low in the west, and
there was a lovely golden light on the water, the
shadows on the willowy shore were deep and mysterious,
a kingfisher flashed along the bank like a
living jewel. The spirits of the school, already
risen to fermenting point, effervesced into stunt
songs composed on the emergency of the moment,
and passed on from boat to boat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>Marooned</h3>
</div>
<p>Amongst other cardinal virtues the practice of
philanthropy was zealously cultivated at Marlowe
Grange. The girls made garments for the local
hospital, contributed towards a cr&egrave;che for soldiers&#8217;
children, and on Sunday mornings put pennies
into a missionary box. Charity is apt to wax a
trifle cold, however, when you never see the object
of your doles; and though ample statistics were
provided about the cr&egrave;che babies, and literature
was sent describing the Chinese orphans and little
Hindoo widows, these pieces of paper information
did not quite supply the place of a real live prot&eacute;g&eacute;.
It was felt to be a decided asset to the school when
old Wilkinson loomed upon their horizon. The
girls discovered him accidentally, engaged in the
meritorious occupation of carrying his own water
from the well. He had opened a gate for them,
and had touched his forelock with the grace and
fervour of a medi&aelig;val retainer. His pink cheeks,
watery blue eyes, snow-white hair, and generally
picturesque personality made the more enthusiastic
members of the art class anxious to paint his
portrait. It was ascertained that he subsisted upon
an old-age pension of five shillings a week, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
resided in a romantic-looking, creeper-covered
cottage just between the Grange and the village.
To visit old Wilkinson, and present him with
potatoes from their own little war-gardens, became
an immediate institution among the girls. There
was no doubt about his gratitude. All was fish
that came to his net, and he accepted anything
and everything, from tea and tobacco to books
which he could not read, with the same toothless
smile and showers of blessings. If, as Miss Gibbs
suggested, his cottage would have been improved
by a little more soap and water, and a good stiff
broom, that did not really matter, as he was generally
sitting outside on a bench beside a beehive,
with a black-and-white Manx cat upon his knee,
and a tame jackdaw hanging in a wicker cage by
the window, exactly like a coloured frontispiece in
a Christmas number of a magazine.</p>
<p>It was a tremendous blow to the school when the
news was circulated that old Wilkinson had received
notice to quit his cottage. The girls were filled
with indignation against his landlord. The fact
that that long-suffering farmer had received no
rent for the last six months, and badly required the
cottage as a billet for lady workers on the land,
went for nothing in the estimation of the Grange
inmates. Wilkinson, so they considered, was a
persecuted old man, about to be evicted from his
home, and a very proper object for sympathy and
consideration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s got to be done for him&mdash;that&#8217;s
flat!&#8221; declared Raymonde. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose
we can allow him to be taken to the workhouse?
It&#8217;s unthinkable! He&#8217;d break his poor old heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
And we&#8217;d miss him so, too. Won&#8217;t the landlord
change his mind and let him stay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Gibbs went to see him about it,&#8221; vouchsafed
Aveline agitatedly, &#8220;and she came back and
shook her head, and said she couldn&#8217;t but feel that
the man was only doing his duty, and women were
wanted on the land, and must have a place to live
in, and someone had to be sacrificed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a victim of the war!&#8221; sighed Morvyth.
&#8220;One of those outside victims who don&#8217;t get Victoria
Crosses and military funerals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t come to a funeral yet!&#8221; bristled Raymonde.
&#8220;The old boy looks good for another ten
years or so. Don&#8217;t you go ordering tombstones
and wreaths!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t going to. How you snap me up! All
the same, I heard Miss Beasley tell Miss Gibbs
that if he has to go to the workhouse it will be
enough to kill him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ve absolutely got to keep him alive!
Won&#8217;t anybody in the village take him in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they&#8217;re all full up, and say they can&#8217;t do
with him, and he hasn&#8217;t any relations of his own
except a drunken granddaughter in a town slum.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde sighed dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to think, and think, and think, and
think, until I find some way of helping him,&#8221; she
announced. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be hard work, because I hate
thinking, but I&#8217;ll do it, you&#8217;ll see!&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde was abstracted that evening, both at
preparation and at supper. In the dormitory she
put aside all conversation with a firm: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
talk to me, I&#8217;m thinking!&#8221; She borrowed Fauvette&#8217;s
bottle of eau-de-Cologne, and went to bed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
with a bandage tied round her head to assist her
cogitations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I shan&#8217;t go to sleep,&#8221; she assured
the others. &#8220;I must just lie awake until the
idea comes to me. Old Wilkinson&#8217;s on my
mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad he&#8217;s not on mine,&#8221; gurgled Aveline,
settling herself comfortably on her pillow. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
you leave him until to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not! I shall wake you up and tell
you when my idea arrives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help!&#8221; murmured her schoolmate, half-asleep.</p>
<p>That night, when the whole household at the
Grange was soundly wrapped in slumber, Aveline
was suddenly brought back from a jumbled dream
of punts, cows, and Latin exercises by feeling somebody
shaking her persistently and urgently.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; she asked, sitting up in
bed. &#8220;Is it Zepps?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh&mdash;sh! Don&#8217;t wake the whole dormitory,
you goose!&#8221; came Raymonde&#8217;s voice in a whisper.
&#8220;Remember Gibbie&#8217;s door&#8217;s wide open, can&#8217;t you?
I&#8217;ve just got my idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aveline promptly lay down again and closed her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t it keep till to-morrow?&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not! You&#8217;ve got to hear it now.
Move further on&mdash;I&#8217;m coming into bed with you.
That&#8217;s better!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m so sleepy,&#8221;&mdash;rather crossly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be horrid! You might wake up for once,
and listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you, then. I said to myself when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
I began to think: &#8216;What&#8217;s wanted is a home for
old Wilkinson!&#8217; and just now it suddenly flashed
into my head: &#8216;We&#8217;ll make him one for ourselves!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the point. The Bumble says she can&#8217;t
have him at the Grange&mdash;Hermie suggested that&mdash;and
every place one knows of seems to belong to
somebody who wants it&mdash;all except the island!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What island? The one on the river?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! Not so far as that. The island on
our moat, I mean. We&#8217;ll build a little house for
him, and he can have it all for his very own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t it be rather difficult to
build?&#8221; gasped Aveline, dazed at the magnitude of
her chum&#8217;s idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not impossible! There are heaps and
heaps of railway sleepers down in the wood heap,
and we could pile them up into a hut. It&#8217;s only
what people do out in Canada. Gibbie&#8217;s always
telling us tales of women who emigrate to the backwoods,
and build colonies of log-cabins. Ave,
you&#8217;re not going to sleep again, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N&mdash;no!&#8221; came a rather languid voice; &#8220;but
how&#8217;ll we ever get to the island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make a raft. We&#8217;ll do it to-morrow, you
and I. Don&#8217;t tell any of the others yet. Morvyth&#8217;s
been so nasty lately, I&#8217;m fed up with her, and
Ardiune would only laugh. When we&#8217;ve got the
thing really started, we&#8217;ll take them over and let
them help, but not till then. Will you promise to
keep it an absolute secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll promise anything you like&#8221;&mdash;wearily&mdash;&#8220;if
you&#8217;ll only go back to your own bed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;m off now&mdash;but just remember
you&#8217;re not to mention it to a single soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde, next day, was tremendously full of
her new scheme. It savoured of romance. Old
Wilkinson would be a combination of a medi&aelig;val
hermit and Robinson Crusoe, and in imagination
she already saw him installed in a picturesque log-cabin,
with his Manx cat and his tame jackdaw for
company. Naturally the first step was to take
possession of the island. It lay in the middle of
the moat, a reedy little domain covered with willows
and bushes. It had never yet been explored by
the school, for the simple reason that there had
been no means of gaining access to it. The water
was too deep for wading, and Miss Beasley had
utterly vetoed the suggestion of procuring a punt.
Raymonde had cast longing eyes at it many times
before, but not until now had she made any real
effort to reach it. She thought out her plans carefully
during the day&mdash;considerably to the detriment
of her lessons&mdash;and when afternoon recreation time
came round she linked Aveline&#8217;s arm firmly in hers,
and led her to the lumber yard. Here, piled up
behind the barn, was a large stack of wood stored
for fuel&mdash;old railway sleepers, bits of broken
fencing, packing-cases, tumbled-down trees, and
brushwood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we want to make first,&#8221; she announced,
&#8220;is a raft. I wonder it never struck me to make it
before!&#8221;</p>
<p>Now rafts sound quite simple and easy when you
read about them in books of adventure. Shipwrecked
mariners on coral islands in the Pacific
always lash a few logs together with incredible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
speed, and perform wonderful journeys through
boiling surf to rescue kegs of provisions and other
useful commodities which they observe floating
about on the waves. The waters of the moat, being
tranquil, and overgrown with duckweed, would
surely prove more hospitable than the surging
ocean, and ought to support a raft, of however
amateur a description. Nevertheless, when they
began to look round, it was more difficult than they
had expected to find just the right material. The
railway sleepers were too large and heavy, and
the fence poles were of unequal lengths. Moreover,
there was nothing with which to lash them
together, for when Raymonde visited the orchard,
intending to purloin a clothes-line, she found the
housemaid there, hanging up a row of pantry towels,
and was obliged to beat a hurried retreat. After
much hunting about, the girls at last discovered
in a corner exactly what they wanted. It was the
door of a demolished shed, made of stout planking,
strongly nailed and braced, and in fairly sound
condition. Nothing could have been better for
their purpose. After first doing a little scouting,
to make sure that the rest of the school were safely
at the other side of the garden, they dragged it
down to the edge of the moat, returning to fetch
two small saplings to act as punt-poles.</p>
<p>&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, let&#8217;s be quick and get off
before anybody comes round and catches us!&#8221;
panted Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you absolutely certain it&#8217;s safe?&#8221; quavered
Aveline dubiously.</p>
<p>Raymonde looked at her scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aveline Kerby, if you don&#8217;t feel yourself up to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
this business, please back out of it at once, and I&#8217;ll
go and fetch Morvyth instead. She may be a
blighter in some things, but she doesn&#8217;t funk!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more do I,&#8221; declared Aveline, suddenly
assuming an air of dignified abandon, reminiscent
of the heroes of coral-island stories. &#8220;I&#8217;m ready
to brave anything, especially for the sake of old
Wilkinson. Don&#8217;t tip the thing so hard at your
end! You&#8217;ve made me trap my fingers!&#8221;</p>
<p>They launched their craft from the water-garden,
treading ruthlessly on Linda&#8217;s irises and Hermie&#8217;s
cherished forget-me-nots. It seemed to float all
right, so they crawled on, and squatted on the
cross-beams on either side of it to preserve its
balance. A good push with their poles sent them
well out on to the moat. It was really a delightful
sensation sailing amongst the duckweed and arrow-head
leaves, although their shoes and skirts got wet
from the water which oozed up between the planks.
The raft behaved splendidly, and, propelled by the
poles, made quite a steady passage. They had
soon crossed the piece of water, and scrambled
out upon the island. It was a rather overgrown,
brambly little domain, and to penetrate its fastnesses
proved a scratchy performance, resulting in
a long rent down the front of Raymonde&#8217;s skirt,
and several tears in Aveline&#8217;s muslin blouse, to say
nothing of wounds on wrists and ankles. There
was quite a clearing in the middle, with soft, mossy
grass and clumps of hemp agrimony, and actually
a small apple-tree with nine apples upon it. They
were green and very sour, but the girls each
sampled one, with a kind of feeling that by so
doing they were taking formal possession of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
territory, though, with Paradise for an analogy, it
should have been just the reverse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have the log-cabin exactly here,&#8221; said
Raymonde, munching abstractedly. &#8220;It&#8217;ll face
the sunset, and he can sit and watch the glowing
west, and hear the evening bells, and&mdash;and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smoke his pipe,&#8221; suggested Aveline unromantically.
&#8220;He generally seems most grateful of all
when one gives him tobacco.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be able to see him sitting there,&#8221;
continued Raymonde, in her most meditative mood.
&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a rose-tree planted beside the door,
and nasturtiums and other thingumbobs for the
bees. It&#8217;ll make a beautiful end to his declining
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Aveline, suppressing a yawn.
She was not so enthusiastic over the scheme as her
chum, and her apple had been much too sour to be
really enjoyed. Raymonde sat twining pieces of
grass round her finger; her eyes were dreamy, and
she hummed &#8220;Those Evening Bells,&#8221; which the
singing class had learnt only the week before.</p>
<p>At that identical moment the clang of a very
different bell disturbed the echoes. The girls
sprang to their feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prep.!&#8221; they gasped in consternation.</p>
<p>They had absolutely no idea it was so late.
Time had simply flown. They must get back
immediately, and even then might expect to lose
order marks. Regardless of scratches, they scurried
through the brambles to the place where they had
left their raft. To their horror it was gone! They
had forgotten to anchor it, and it had floated out
into the middle of the moat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>This was indeed a predicament! They looked at
each other aghast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re marooned, that&#8217;s what it is!&#8221; stammered
Aveline. &#8220;Raymonde, you&#8217;re the silliest idiot I&#8217;ve
ever met in the course of my life!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t help it&mdash;it&#8217;s the truth! Whatever did
you bring me out here for, on such a wild-goose
chase?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you wanted to come!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t! You&#8217;ve landed me in a horrible
scrape. I&#8217;ve been late for prep. twice already this
week, and Gibbie gave me enough jaw-wag last
time, so what she&#8217;ll say this time, goodness knows!
How are we ever going to get back?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde shook her head and whistled. She
might have attempted to defend herself, but Aveline
by this time had begun to sob hysterically, and she
knew that arguments were useless. The prospects
of immediate rescue certainly appeared doubtful.
Everyone would be indoors for preparation. No
doubt they would be missed, and probably a monitress
might be sent in quest of them, but the house
would be searched first, and then the barns and
garden; and it was quite problematical whether it
would enter into anybody&#8217;s head to walk to the
edge of the moat, and look across towards the
island.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you can&#8217;t swim?&#8221; asked Aveline,
choking back her sobs, and dabbing her eyes with
her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; only a little bit when somebody holds me
up. Whoever would have thought of that wretched
raft floating off in that fashion? It&#8217;s too sickening!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d better give a good shout?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls put their united lung power into the
loudest halloo of which they were capable, but it
only scared a blackbird in the orchard, and provoked
no human response. They sat down in a
place where they could be best seen from the mainland,
and waited. There were too many brambles
for comfort, and the midges were biting badly.
Raymonde began to wonder whether, after all, the
island were as ideal a situation for a residence as
she had supposed. Some lines from a parody on
one of Rogers&#8217;s poems flashed into her mind:</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;So damp my cot beside the rill,<br />
The beehive fails to soothe my ear&#8221;;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>and</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Around my ivy-covered porch<br />
Earwigs and snails are ever crawling.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;It mightn&#8217;t be just the best place in the world
for rheumatism,&#8221; she decided, &#8220;and probably there&#8217;d
be just heaps of snails and slugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we shout again?&#8221; suggested Aveline forlornly.</p>
<p>The chums called, whistled, halloed, and cooeed
until they were hoarse, but not a soul took the
slightest notice. Time, which had sped so rapidly
during their first twenty minutes on the island,
now crawled on laggard wings. After what appeared
to them an absolutely interminable period,
but which was in reality about an hour and a half,
the familiar figure of Hermie Graveson suddenly
appeared on the mainland close to the water-garden.
Raymonde and Aveline started up, and
emitted yells that would have done credit to a pair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
of Zulu warriors on the war-path. Hermie waved
frantically, shouted something they could not hear,
and ran back towards the house. In a few minutes
she returned with Miss Gibbs. That worthy lady
picked up her skirts and advanced gingerly to the
extreme limit of the stones that bordered the water-garden.
She put her hands to her mouth to form
a speaking-trumpet, and bawled a communication
of which the marooned ones could only catch such
fragments as &#8220;How ... get ... doing ...&#8221;</p>
<p>On the presumption that it was an enquiry into
their means of locomotion, they pointed sadly to
the floating raft. Miss Beasley now came hurrying
up, surveyed the situation, and also attempted
to converse, but with no better success. After an
agitated colloquy with Miss Gibbs she retired.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;you think they&#8217;ll have to leave us here for the
night?&#8221; fluttered Aveline anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. It looks like it, unless anyone
can swim!&#8221; returned Raymonde, with what stoicism
she could muster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;ll hire a cart to the river, and fetch
up a punt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll take hours to do that!&#8221;</p>
<p>The prospect of supper and bed seemed to be
retreating further and further into the dim and faraway
distance. Aveline remembered that it was
the evening for stewed pears and custard, and tears
dripped down her cheeks on to her torn blouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! brace up, can&#8217;t you?&#8221; snapped Raymonde.
&#8220;It gives me spasms to hear you sniff!&#8221;</p>
<p>Aveline was bursting into an indignant retort,
when her companion nudged her and pointed to
the mainland.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>Mackenzie, the old gardener, was coming across
the orchard carrying on his shoulder a very large
wash-tub. The cook followed him, bearing a
clothes-prop.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve the best brains in the house! He&#8217;s
going to rescue us!&#8221; exclaimed Raymonde ecstatically.</p>
<p>The prisoners on the island watched with deep
interest while Mackenzie launched his shallop,
clambered in, and seizing the clothes-prop from
Cook, pushed off cautiously. His craft was very
low in the water and looked particularly wobbly,
and they were terribly afraid it would upset. In
spite of their anxiety they could not help seeing
the humorous side of the episode, and they choked
with laughter as the tub gyrated and bobbed about,
and the old man clutched frantically at his pole.
He made first of all for the floating raft, secured it
with a piece of rope, and dragged it to the island.
The girls straightened their faces and welcomed
him with polite expressions of gratitude.</p>
<p>He received their thanks ungraciously&mdash;perhaps
he had seen them laughing&mdash;pushed the raft to a
spot where they could board it, and remarked
tartly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye deserve to stop where ye are the night, in
my opeenion. Get on with ye now, and paddle
yerselves back. Giving a body all this trouble&mdash;and
me with my leg bad, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was possibly a satisfaction to Mackenzie that
Miss Beasley shared his views as to the culpability
of the delinquents and the necessity of giving them
their deserts. They were summoned to the study
after prayers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What did she say?&#8221; whispered Ardiune, Morvyth,
and Katherine, as they escorted the crestfallen
pair upstairs to the dormitory.</p>
<p>&#8220;All recreation stopped for three days, and learn
the whole of Gray&#8217;s Elegy!&#8221; choked the sinners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gray&#8217;s Elegy! You&#8217;ll never do it! Oh, you
poor chickens! The Bumble can be a perfect beast
sometimes! I say, what was it like on the island?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Top-hole!&#8221; responded Raymonde, as she
mopped her eyes.</p>
<p>The very next day came the news that the farmer
had decided to run up a number of corrugated-iron
hutments in one of his own fields to accommodate
his lady workers, and that the Squire had promised
to pay the rent of old Wilkinson&#8217;s cottage so long
as he was left there undisturbed. Everybody felt
it was a happy solution of the difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, the island might have been rather
an awkward place for him,&#8221; admitted Raymonde.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how he&#8217;d have got backwards and
forwards without a drawbridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he&#8217;d used a wash-tub,&#8221; giggled Aveline.
&#8220;I shan&#8217;t forget Mackenzie in a hurry! It was the
funniest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen in my life. Talk of
people looking sour! He might have been eating
sloes. Cook&#8217;s taken it personally, I&#8217;m afraid. I
asked her for some whitening this morning to
clean my regimental button, and she scowled and
wouldn&#8217;t let me have any&mdash;nasty, stingy old thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a weary world!&#8221; sighed Raymonde. &#8220;Especially
when you&#8217;ve got to learn the whole of Gray&#8217;s
Elegy by heart!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>The Fossil Hunters</h3>
</div>
<p>If Miss Beasley had been asked what was her most
difficult problem in the management of her school,
she would probably have replied the arrangement
of the practising time-table. With the exception
of four, all the girls learned music, and therefore,
for a period of forty-five minutes daily, each of these
twenty-two pupils must do execution on the piano.
There were five instruments at the Grange, and,
except during the hours of morning lessons and
meals, they hardly ever seemed to be silent. At
seven o&#8217;clock they began with scales, arpeggios,
and studies, and passed during the day through
a selection of pieces, classical and modern, in such
various degrees of playing, strumming, and thumping
as might be calculated to wear out their hammers
and snap their strings in double quick time. About
half of the girls learned from Mademoiselle, and
the remainder had lessons from Mr. Browne, a
visiting master who came twice a week to the
school. He was a short little man, with sandy
hair, and a bald patch in the middle of it, and a
Vandyke beard that was turning rather grey. He
was himself an excellent musician, and sometimes
the performances of his pupils offended his sensitive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
ear to the point of exasperation, and he would
storm at them in a gurgling voice, blinking his
short-sighted hazel eyes very rapidly, and wrinkling
up his forehead till it looked like squeezed india-rubber.
It was on record that he had once hit Lois
Barlow a hard crack over the knuckles with his
fountain-pen, whereupon she wept&mdash;not so much
from pain as from injured feelings&mdash;and he had
apologized in quite a gentlemanly fashion, and
picked up the music that in his burst of temper he
had flung upon the floor. In spite of his acknowledged
irritability, all the girls who learned from
him gave themselves airs of slight superiority over
those who only learned from Mademoiselle. Though
strict, he was an inspiring teacher, and when, as
occasionally happened, he would push his pupil
from the stool, and seat himself in her place to show
the proper rendering of some passage, the music
that followed was like a lovely liquid dream of
sound.</p>
<p>Professor Marshall also attended the school twice
a week to lecture on literature and natural science.
He was a much greater general favourite than Mr.
Browne; everybody appreciated his affable manner
and bland smile, and the little jokes with which he
punctuated his remarks.</p>
<p>The girls always felt that it made a change to
have anybody coming in from the outside world.
The one disadvantage of a boarding-school is that
mistresses and pupils, shut up together, and seeing
one another week in, week out, are rather apt to
get on each others&#8217; nerves. At a day school the
girls take their worries home at four o&#8217;clock, and
the mental atmosphere has time to clear before nine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
next morning; but, when there is no home-going
until the end of the term, little trifles are sometimes
unduly magnified, and a narrow element&mdash;the bane
of all communities&mdash;begins to creep in. To do
Miss Beasley justice, she made a great effort to
combat this very evil, and to run her school on
broad lines. She recognized the necessity of letting
the girls mix sometimes with outsiders. In a
country place it was impossible to take them to
concerts or entertainments, but they occasionally
joined the rambles of the County Antiquarian
Society or the local Natural History Club.</p>
<p>It occurred to Miss Beasley that it would be an
excellent plan to throw open some of Professor
Marshall&#8217;s lectures to residents in the neighbourhood,
asking those people who attended to stay to
tea afterwards, thus giving her girls an opportunity
of acting as hostesses, and entertaining them with
conversation. A short course of four lectures on
geology was announced, and quite a number of
local ladies responded to the invitation. The girls
received the news with mixed feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather a jink!&#8221; ventured Ardiune. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be
queer to see rows of strangers sitting in the lecture
room! Did you say we&#8217;ve to give them tea when
the Professor&#8217;s done talking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and talk to them ourselves too, worse
luck! I&#8217;m sure I shan&#8217;t know what to say!&#8221;
fluttered Aveline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the monitresses will do that part of the
business!&#8221; decided Raymonde easily. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
stand in the background, and just look ladylike
and well-mannered, and all the rest of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you, my child? Not if the Bumble knows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
it! She&#8217;s nuts on this afternoon-tea dodge! (I
don&#8217;t care&mdash;I shan&#8217;t put a penny in the slang box&mdash;Hermie
isn&#8217;t here to listen and make me!) Gibbie
told me that we&#8217;re all to act hostesses in turn.
We&#8217;re to be divided into four sets, and each take
a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help! How are you going to divide twenty-six
by four? It works out at six and a half.
Who&#8217;s to be the half girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! They&#8217;ll make it seven on one afternoon
and six the next, I expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not fair! It&#8217;s throwing too much work
on those six and not enough on the seven. It&#8217;s
opposed to all the instincts of co-operation and
justice which Gibbie has laboured so hard to instil
into me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see how the Bumble can manage otherwise,
unless she chops a girl in half. No, I predict
you&#8217;ll be chosen among a select six, and have to
pour out tea and hand cakes with one-sixth extra
power laid on, and your conversation carefully
modulated to your hearers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jemima!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please to remember that this is a finishing
school!&#8221; mocked Ardiune. &#8220;Don&#8217;t on any account
shock the neighbourhood by an unseemly exhibition
of vulgar slang!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll slip out, I know, when I&#8217;m not thinking,&#8221;
groaned Raymonde.</p>
<p>On the first afternoon of the geological course,
an audience of about twenty visitors augmented the
usual gathering in the lecture hall. They were
accommodated with the best seats, and the school
occupied the third and fourth rows. Directly in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
front of Raymonde sat an elderly lady in a large
black hat trimmed with cherries, which bobbed
temptingly over the brim. She appeared to take
an interest in her surroundings, glanced about the
room, and turned a reproving eye on Raymonde,
who ventured to whisper to Aveline. With Miss
Gibbs hovering in the background with a now-mind-you-keep-up-the-credit-of-the-school
expression,
the girls hardly dared even to blink, but
Aveline managed to write: &#8220;What a Tartar in
front!&#8221; on a slip of paper, and hand it to her
chum.</p>
<p>The Professor, bland as ever, was coming into
the room and hanging a geological map over the
blackboard. He smiled broadly, showing his large
white teeth to the uttermost, and, after a few preliminary
remarks of welcome to the visitors, plunged
into a description of the earth&#8217;s crust.</p>
<p>All went well for a while; then an untoward
incident happened. The lady with the cherries in
her hat, who had possibly taken cold, or was
affected by the pollen in the flowers upon the table,
sneezed violently, not only once, but twice, and even
a third time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three&#8217;s for a wedding! Is it Gibbie?&#8221; whispered
Raymonde the incorrigible.</p>
<p>Aveline&#8217;s mental equilibrium was always easily
upset. The idea of Miss Gibbs in connection with
matrimony was too much for her, and she exploded
into a series of painfully suppressed giggles. The
more she tried to stop, the more hysterical she grew,
especially as her lack of self-control appeared to
produce great agitation among the cherries on the
black hat in front. It was only by holding her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
breath till she almost choked that she managed
to avoid disgracing herself absolutely.</p>
<p>As Morvyth had predicted, Raymonde was
among the hostesses for the afternoon. She rose
admirably to the occasion, handed round cakes and
bread and butter, and talked sweetly to the guests
on a variety of topics. Aveline, also one of the
chosen, though less agile in conversation, tried to
look &#8220;hospitable&#8221; and &#8220;welcoming,&#8221; and cultured
and pretty-mannered and gracious, and everything
else which might be expected from a young lady at
a finishing-school.</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs, who was keeping the deportment
of the hostesses well under inspection, beamed
approval, but spurred them on to fresh efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;See that nobody is neglected,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;Hand the cakes to that lady who is standing by
the piano; and you, Raymonde, take her the
cream.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chums had instinctively avoided the owner
of the black hat with the cherries, but thus urged
they were bound to fulfil their social obligations.
They offered a selection of ginger-nuts and fancy
biscuits, and the best silver cream-jug, and murmured
some polite nothings on the hackneyed
subject of the weather. The lady helped herself,
and regarded them with an offended eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you&#8217;re the two girls who sat behind
me during the lecture!&#8221; she remarked tartly. &#8220;I
should like to say that I considered your behaviour
disgraceful. It would serve you right if I were to
tell your governess.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with confusion, Raymonde and
Aveline beat a hasty retreat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Does she think I was laughing at
her?&#8221; whispered Aveline. &#8220;What must I do?
Ought I to go and explain and apologize? I simply
daren&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a nasty old thing!&#8221; returned Raymonde
in an indignant undertone. &#8220;I hope she won&#8217;t
sneak to Gibbie! You can&#8217;t explain. I shouldn&#8217;t
go near her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gibbie&#8217;s working round towards the piano!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mrs. Horner&#8217;s stopped her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately for the girls, at this moment Professor
Marshall cleared his throat violently, and,
obtaining by this signal a temporary respite in the
babel of small talk, announced that on the following
Saturday afternoon he proposed to lead a party
to Littlewood Quarry to examine the geological
formation there, and search for fossils. He hoped
that all the present company would be able to
attend, as the expedition would be of great educational
value. The general conversation in the room
immediately turned upon geology. The black hat
with cherries bore down upon the Professor, and its
owner plunged into a lengthy discussion on the
flora of the carboniferous period, so apparently
absorbing that it left her no opportunity to lodge
complaints as to the behaviour of the pupils. The
chums, whose social duties were now finished,
slipped thankfully away to prep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disgusted with the Professor!&#8221; groaned
Morvyth. &#8220;It&#8217;s too bad of him to take up another
of our precious Saturday afternoons with
his geology excursion. The tennis match will be
all off now, and I know we could have beaten
the Sixth! I don&#8217;t want to hunt for fossils!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
I&#8217;m tired of continually having my mind improved!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We really don&#8217;t get a fair chance for games at
this school,&#8221; Ardiune grumbled in sympathy. &#8220;I
wish Gibbie were sporting instead of intellectual!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was really a grievance to the girls to be obliged
to abandon tennis on this occasion. The match
between Sixth and Fifth had been a fixture, and
each side had hopes of its own champions. Daphne
and Barbara were good players, but Valentine and
Muriel had been practising early and late, and in
the estimation of their own Form were well in the
running for victory. Even the juniors had looked
forward to witnessing the combat. Valentine, in
her disappointment, went so far as to suggest to
Miss Gibbs that the match might claim precedence
over the excursion. The astonished mistress gazed
at her for a moment with blank face, then burst
out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Give up the fossil hunt in favour of tennis!
What nonsense! You ought all to be deeply
grateful to Professor Marshall for coming to take
us. You girls don&#8217;t appreciate your privileges!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one compensation,&#8221; urged Fauvette.
&#8220;We shall walk through the village, and, if we
break line a little, it will give a chance for somebody
to dash into the shop and buy pear-drops.
One had better do it for us all, and get a pound.
We&#8217;ll pay up our shares, honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the afternoon of Saturday, twenty-six rather
apathetic geologists started forth from the Grange.
Each carried a basket, and a few, who had scrambled
first, had secured hammers. Miss Gibbs, armed
with &#8220;An Illustrated Catalogue of the Fossils in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
the Bradbury Museum,&#8221; by means of which she
hoped to identify specimens, brought up the rear,
in company with Veronica, and the school crocodiled
in orthodox fashion as far as the village.
Here they were met by the Vicar&#8217;s wife and
daughter, and several other ladies who were to
join the excursion. The double line swayed and
broke. Miss Gibbs&#8217;s attention became engaged by
visitors, and, during the few minutes&#8217; halt, Raymonde,
well covered by her comrades, seized the
golden opportunity, darted into the shop, and
emerged with a large packet hidden in her basket,
before mistress or monitresses had had time to miss
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paradise drops!&#8221; she announced with gleeful
caution. &#8220;Got them because they were on the
counter, and the quickest thing I could buy. No,
I daren&#8217;t dole them out now. You must wait till
we get to the quarry. Gibbie&#8217;d notice you sucking
them, you idiots!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was rather a long way to Littlewood. Much
too far, in the girls&#8217; opinion, though they would
have thought nothing of the walk had they been
keener on its object.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t have minded so much if we&#8217;d come
on a Thursday, and missed French translation.
Why had it to be Saturday?&#8221; groused Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Saturday&#8217;s the only day the men
aren&#8217;t working in the quarry. For goodness&#8217; sake,
stop grumbling!&#8221; returned Hermie in her most
monitressy manner. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t enjoy things
yourself, let other people have a chance, at any
rate!&#8221;</p>
<p>Duly snubbed, Ardiune subsided, and tramped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
on in silence, her discontent slightly alleviated by
the prospect of Paradise drops, for Raymonde was
rattling the basket suggestively to cheer her up.
Extra visitors joined the party here and there upon
the way, and outside Littlewood village the Professor
himself was waiting for them, beaming as
usual, and carrying a most professional-looking
hammer, and a little bass for specimens. He
greeted them with one of his customary jokes, and
they smiled obediently, more out of habit than
inclination.</p>
<p>The quarry proved more exciting than they had
anticipated. It was a large place, and to get down
into it they were obliged to descend several steep
ladders, leading from one platform to another.
Arrived at the bottom level, Professor Marshall
collected his students in a group round him, and
delivered a lecturette upon the points to be noticed
in the strata surrounding them. Raymonde listened
sadly. It seemed to her an unprofitable way of
spending a Saturday afternoon. She brightened,
however, when the audience dispersed to commence
practical work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along!&#8221; she whispered to her chums.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s scoot over there and begin to chop rocks!
Quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the Paradise drops?&#8221; enquired the
others eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I have them safe. Only wait till
Gibbie&#8217;s back is turned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though they were decidedly tired of lectures, the
girls nevertheless were quite mildly interested in
searching for fossils. There was an element of
competition about it which appealed to them, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
when Hermie found a fine specimen of <i>Cupressocrinus
crassus</i>, the Fifth felt that they must not be
outdone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t got anything really decent yet!&#8221;
sighed Aveline, watching with envious eyes as
Hermie exhibited her treasure to the admiring
visitors. &#8220;The Sixth are cackling ever so hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go over there,&#8221; suggested Raymonde.
&#8220;No one&#8217;s explored that bit of the quarry. We
might find all sorts of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mystic Seven, who generally clung together
in their undertakings, scaled a ladder therefore,
climbed a mound of refuse, and found themselves
on new ground. They dispersed, and each searched
to the best of her ability among the pieces of crumbly
rock that were lying about. Aveline, absorbed in
splitting strata with her hammer, was suddenly disturbed
by a piercing yell and a shout of &#8220;Help!&#8221;
She ran at once in the direction of the screams,
and round the corner discovered Raymonde, sunk
nearly to her waist in a kind of clay bog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me!&#8221; she implored. &#8220;I can&#8217;t get out.
The more I try, the deeper I seem to sink in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t struggle, then; wait a minute,&#8221; said
Aveline, advancing on to some firm-looking stones
and stretching out a hand. &#8220;Can you manage
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde made a desperate but futile effort.
&#8220;No, I&#8217;m stuck tight&mdash;can&#8217;t move my legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pull me, or I&#8217;ll be in too! Now, I&#8217;m
going to tug one of your legs out! That&#8217;s it! Now
the other! Here you are! Good gracious! What
a mess you&#8217;re in!&#8221;</p>
<p>Arrived on firm ground, Raymonde certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
looked a deplorable object. Her feet were two
shapeless lumps of wet clay. She regarded them
with rueful consternation. Ardiune came running
up, and, being of a practical turn of mind, set to
work to scrape her friend clean with a thin piece
of stone. She succeeded in removing the bulk of
the matter adhering to her, but there still remained
a most unsightly coating of mud.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing to get yourself in such
a fix?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It looked quite solid, and then,
when I stepped on it, I just sank in&mdash;squash! I
might have been swallowed up in it and killed,
if Ave hadn&#8217;t tugged me out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look a nice object to walk home with!&#8221;
giggled Aveline. &#8220;What&#8217;ll Gibbie say?&#8221;</p>
<p>What Miss Gibbs remarked when she saw the
state of her pupil&#8217;s garments was:</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, Raymonde, I might have known you
would be sure to do some stupid thing! No other
girl in the school has fallen into the mud. Why
didn&#8217;t you keep with the rest, and look where you
were going? You&#8217;re more trouble than everybody
else put together. If you can&#8217;t behave yourself
when you come on an excursion, you must be left
behind to do some preparation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mystics consoled their leader as best they
could, offering her their last remaining Paradise
drops, and walking in a clump round her through
the village to shield her from observation. Ardiune,
who was poetically inclined, thought the occasion
worthy of being celebrated in verse, and at bedtime
handed Raymonde the following effusion,
illustrated with spirited sketches in black lead-pencil,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
representing her with clay-covered feet of
gigantic proportions.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>

Raymonde, a nice and cheerful child<br />

&nbsp;<br />
By lengthy ladders undismayed,<br />

With firm resolve to hit and hew,<br />

</td></tr></table>
<p>&#8220;Humph! Good for you, Ardiune!&#8221; commented
Raymonde. &#8220;Not much tenderness about Gibbie,
though! And I didn&#8217;t see anybody&#8217;s fond tears!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
You all laughed at me! My feet weren&#8217;t a yard
long, anyway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poetic and artistic license allows a few slight
exaggerations. Even Shakespeare took liberties
with his subjects!&#8221; returned the authoress blandly.
&#8220;If not exactly a yard long, your feet, not small
by nature, looked absolutely enormous! It&#8217;s the

</td></tr></table>
<p>chanted Raymonde, dancing into the dormitory
and plumping down on Fauvette&#8217;s bed amid a pile
of chiffons, muslins, and other flimsy articles of
wearing apparel. &#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter, child?
Whence this spread-out? You look weepy! Packing
to go home? Mother ill? Or are you expelled?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; gulped Fauvette with a watery smile.
&#8220;It&#8217;s only her&mdash;Mademoiselle! She&#8217;s turned all
my drawers out on to the floor, and says I&#8217;ve got
to tidy them. She lectured me hard in French.
I couldn&#8217;t understand half of what she said, but I
knew she was scolding. And I&#8217;ve to sort all these
things out, and put them neatly away, and mend up
everything that needs mending before this evening,
or else she&#8217;ll tell the Bumble to come and look at
them, and I shall get &#8216;sadly lacking in order&#8217; down
in my report again. It&#8217;s too bad!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s positively brutal of Mademoiselle!&#8221; said
Raymonde reflectively. &#8220;If it had been Gibbie,
now, it would have been no surprise to me. Don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
cry, you little silly! You look like a weeping
cherub on a monument! Shovel your clothes back
again into your drawers, and put a tidy top layer.
That&#8217;s what I always do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; wailed Fauvette. &#8220;But it won&#8217;t work
this time. Mademoiselle was really cross, and I
could see she means to come to-night, and hold
what she calls &#8216;une inspection&#8217;. She said something
about making me an example. Why, if she
wants an example, need she choose me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly breaking a butterfly,&#8221; agreed
Raymonde. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s something seriously
wrong with Mademoiselle. She&#8217;s completely
altered this last week. She never used to worry
about things, and she&#8217;s suddenly turned as fussy as
Gibbie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde was not the only one who had noticed
the change in the French mistress. It was apparent
to everybody. Her entire character seemed suddenly
to have altered. Whereas beforetime she
had been easygoing, slack, and ready to shut eyes
and ears to school-girl failings, she was now keenly
vigilant and highly exacting. In classes and at
music lessons she demanded the utmost attention,
and no longer passed over mistakes, or allowed a
bad accent. She prohibited the use of the English
tongue altogether during meals, and insisted upon
her pupils conversing in French, requiring each
one to come to table primed with a suitable remark
in that language. The number of fines which she
inflicted was so heavy that the missionary box
filled with a rapidity more gratifying to the local
secretary of the society than to the contributors.
The girls were considerably puzzled at this change
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
of face on the part of Mademoiselle, but Morvyth
and Katherine gave it as their opinion that Miss
Beasley lay at the back of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bumble&#8217;s probably had a talk with her,
and told her she must buck up or go!&#8221; suggested
the former. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure she always thought Mademoiselle
a slacker&mdash;which she certainly was! Possibly
she&#8217;s given her till the end of the term to show
what she&#8217;s capable of, and if she doesn&#8217;t come up
to the mark, we shall start next term with a new
French governess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t care!&#8221; said Raymonde easily. &#8220;I
never liked her much. We used to call her &#8216;the
butterfly&#8217;, but she&#8217;s &#8216;the mosquito&#8217; now. She&#8217;s
developing a very unpleasant sting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever might be the truth of Morvyth&#8217;s surmises
as to the reason of Mademoiselle&#8217;s new attitude,
the fact loomed large. Having determined
to demonstrate her powers of discipline, she overdid
it. She was one of those persons who cannot keep
order and enforce rules without losing their tempers,
and she stormed at the girls continually. She
developed a mania for what she called &#8220;surveillance.&#8221;
She was continually paying surprise visits
to dormitory or schoolroom, and pouncing upon
offenders who were talking, or otherwise neglecting
their duties. It was even suspected that she listened
behind doors. Fauvette, whose babyish characteristics
led her into many pitfalls, seemed suddenly
to become the scapegoat of Mademoiselle&#8217;s freshly
acquired vigilance. Fauvette lacked spirit, and
went down like a ninepin before the least word of
reproof. Her feelings were easily hurt, and her
tears always close to the surface. She sat now and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
sobbed pathetically upon her pillow, without making
the least effort to tidy up her belongings. Raymonde
shook her head over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the sort of girl who ought to go through
life with a nurse or a maid to look after you; you&#8217;re
not fit to take care of yourself,&#8221; she decided.
&#8220;Look here, how much wants doing to your clothes
before the Mosquito comes buzzing round to inspect?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoals!&#8221; sighed Fauvette wearily. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
I&#8217;ve left my mending. There are stockings, and
gloves, and&mdash;all kinds of things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you get it done in time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; and the tears dripped again on to
a dainty muslin collar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s nothing for it but to get up a
Mending Bee, and help you! We seven are sworn
to stick together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be squalls if you&#8217;re caught in the
dormitory during recreation. I was told to stay
here,&#8221; cautioned Fauvette.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to risk something,&#8221; returned Raymonde
cheerily, scurrying off in search of the remaining
five of the Mystics.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve all got to fetch work-baskets and come
this instant,&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;It&#8217;s an urgency
call, like last term when we made T bandages for
Roumania, and nose-bags for the horses, only it&#8217;s
even more important and urgent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Armed with their sewing materials, the girls
slipped one by one upstairs, and, settling themselves
upon the beds in the immediate vicinity of Fauvette&#8217;s,
set to work. It was a formidable task. Their comrade
had brought a large assortment of garments
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
to school with her, and had happily left them
unmended, trusting to take them home to be repaired.
At present they were mixed in a hopeless
jumble on the floor and on her bed, just where
Mademoiselle had tipped out the drawers. Stockings,
underclothes, gloves, handkerchiefs, photos,
old letters, ribbons, ties, beads, lockets, books, and
an assortment of odd treasures were lying together
in utter confusion.</p>
<p>Fauvette brightened at the sight of her friends,
mopped her eyes, and pushed back her fluffy hair
from her hot forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brace up!&#8221; Raymonde encouraged her.
&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to help unless you&#8217;ll do your
own share. Sort those things out, and be putting
them in your drawers while we do your mending.
Morvyth, take these stockings; Katherine, you&#8217;re
artistic, so I&#8217;ll give you baby ribbon to thread
through these bodices. Ardiune, you may mend
gloves. Ave, collect those hair ribbons, and put
them neatly inside that box, and stack those photos
together. Why they&#8217;re not in an album I can&#8217;t
imagine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I generally sleep with one or two of
them under my pillow,&#8221; confessed Fauvette.
&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I, if I like? There&#8217;s no harm in
it. Oh! please be careful with those beads, you&#8217;ll
break the strings!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think why you need so many empty
chocolate boxes,&#8221; commented Aveline, sweeping
up treasures with a ruthless hand. &#8220;Your drawers
will be so full they won&#8217;t shut. Throw half of them
away!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! I always keep them to remind me of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the people who gave them to me. You mustn&#8217;t
throw any of them away. They&#8217;re chock-full of
memories.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather have them chock-full of chocs, myself!&#8221;
remarked Morvyth dryly. &#8220;Fauvette, you&#8217;re interesting
and pretty&mdash;when you don&#8217;t cry (for goodness&#8217;
sake look at your red eyes in the glass!); but
you&#8217;re as sentimental as an Early Victorian heroine.
You ought to wear a bonnet and a crinoline, and
carry a little fringed parasol, and talk about your
&#8216;papa&#8217;! If you don&#8217;t get safely engaged to an
officer before you&#8217;re out of your teens, you&#8217;ll turn
into one of those faded females who bore one with
sickly reminiscences of their past, and spend the
remainder of your life pampering a pet poodle.
Here, I&#8217;ve mended two pairs of stockings for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve done three pairs,&#8221; said Raymonde,
folding up the articles in question and putting
them in her friend&#8217;s second long drawer. &#8220;We&#8217;re
getting on. Kathy, have you finished the bodices?
We&#8217;ll soon have you straightened up, Baby, and if
Mademoiselle&#8211;&#8211;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde&#8217;s sudden ejaculation was caused by a
vision of no less a person than Miss Gibbs, who
was standing in the doorway of the dormitory regarding
the sewing party in some astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you girls doing here?&#8221; she demanded,
making a bee-line for them among the beds.</p>
<p>Nobody answered, and for a moment or two
blank dismay spread itself over the countenances
of the Mystics. Then Raymonde&#8217;s lucky star came
to the rescue, and popped an inspiration into her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were telling us in Social History class
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
yesterday, Miss Gibbs, about the necessity of women
co-operating in their work if they are ever to command
a higher scale of pay,&#8221; she explained glibly;
&#8220;so we thought we&#8217;d better begin to put our principles
into practice. Fauvette had fallen into arrears,
and was in danger of&mdash;er&mdash;trouble, so we all came
just to boost her up to standard, and let her get
a fair start again. It&#8217;s on the basis of a Women&#8217;s
Union or&mdash;or&mdash;Freemasons. We thought we were
bound to help one another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Gibbs was not a remarkably humorous person,
but on this occasion the corners of her mouth
were distinctly observed to twitch. She mastered
the weakness instantly, however, and remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear that you are interested in
co-operation. This is certainly a practical demonstration
of the theory, and Fauvette ought to be
grateful to you. Be quick and finish straightening
the things, and, if anybody asks questions, you may
say that you have my permission to remain here
until tea-time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls sat at attention till the door closed upon
their mistress, then their mingled amazement and
gratitude burst forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Gibbie!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an absolute sport to-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never known her in such a jinky mood before!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact of the matter is,&#8221; observed Raymonde
sagely, &#8220;I believe Gibbie absolutely loathes Mademoiselle,
and that for once in a way she&#8217;s not above
taking a legitimate chance of paying her out.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the French mistress came round that evening
on her tour of inspection, she found Fauvette&#8217;s
drawers in apple-pie order right to the very bottoms&mdash;beads,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
ties, and collars carefully arranged
in boxes, and nicely mended stockings placed in
a row.</p>
<p>&#8220;It only show vat you can do ven you try!&#8221; she
commented. &#8220;In a woman to be untidy is&mdash;ah!
I have not your English idiom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The limit!&#8221; wickedly suggested Raymonde,
who was standing close by.</p>
<p>But Mademoiselle, who had been warned against
the acquisition of slang, glared at her till she beat
a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>It was growing near to the end of the term, and
examinations loomed imminently on the horizon.
They were to be conducted this year by Miss Beasley&#8217;s
brother, a clergyman, and a former lecturer
at Oxford. He had made a special study of modern
languages, so that his standard of requirement in
regard to French grammar was likely to be a high
one. Up till now the Fifth Form had plodded
through D&eacute;jardin&#8217;s exercises in an easy fashion,
without worrying greatly about the multitude of
their mistakes, over which their mistress had indeed
shaken her head, but had made no special
crusade to amend. Now, in view of the awe-inspiring
visit of the Reverend T. W. Beasley,
M.A., Mademoiselle had instituted an eleventh-hour
spurt of diligence, and kept her pupils with
reluctant noses pressed hard to the grindstone.
Irregular verbs and exceptions of gender seemed
much worse when taken in such large doses. The
girls began to wish either that the Tower of Babel
had never been attempted, or that the world had
reached a sufficient stage of civilization to adopt a
universal language. Over one point in particular
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
they considered that they had a just and pressing
grievance. The French classes of Form V came
on the time-table from 12 to 12.30, being the last
subjects of morning school. Dinner was at one
o&#8217;clock, and in the intervening half-hour the girls
put away their books, washed their hands and tidied
their hair, and refreshed their flagging spirits by
a run round the garden. Mademoiselle had been
wont to close her book at the exact minute of the
half-hour, but now she utterly ignored the clock,
and would go on with the lesson till a quarter or
even ten minutes to one. The wrath of the Form
knew no bounds. They valued their short exercise
before dinner extremely. To have it thus cut off
was an infringement of their rights. Mademoiselle,
who was perfectly aware that she was exceeding
the limit of the time-table, sheltered herself behind
excuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ven I take your verbs I forget it is so late,&#8221;
she would remark. &#8220;Ze lesson slip avay, and ve
not yet done all ve should.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls held an indignation meeting to discuss
the subject. Even Maudie Heywood&#8217;s appetite for
knowledge was glutted by this extra diet of French
syntax, and Muriel Fuller and Magsie Mawson,
amiable nonentities who rarely ruffled the surface
of the school waters, for once verified the proverb
that the worm will turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not fair!&#8221; raged Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;m&#8217;selle knows she ought to stop at half-past!&#8221;
urged Magsie in injured tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s taking a mean advantage!&#8221; echoed Muriel.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we can&#8217;t really work properly when she
goes on so long!&#8221; wailed Maudie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I vote we strike!&#8221; suggested Morvyth fiercely.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s tell her we won&#8217;t go in for the exam. at all,
if she goes on lengthening out the lessons.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several of the Form brightened up at the suggestion,
but Aveline, a shade more practical, shook
her head discouragingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do, there&#8217;ll be a fine old row! The
Mosquito&#8217;ll appeal to the Bumble, who&#8217;d have her
back up directly. I think we&#8217;d better not try that
on. We don&#8217;t want to take home &#8216;conduct disgraceful&#8217;
in our reports.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ave&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Raymonde. &#8220;We know
the Bumble! This is a matter for tact, not brute
force. We must manage Mademoiselle. She pretends
she forgets the time&mdash;very well, then, we
must take steps to bring it palpably to her notice.
Will you leave the matter in my hands? I&#8217;ve got
an idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde&#8217;s inspirations were so well known
in the Form, that the rest willingly consented to
appoint her as a sub-committee of one to undertake
the full management of the affair. Before the next
French class she made a tour of the monitresses&#8217;
bedrooms. They had instituted an early-rising
society among themselves this term, and almost
everyone was provided with an alarum-clock. Raymonde
boldly borrowed five of these, without asking
leave of their owners, and set them all carefully
for 12.30, winding them up to their fullest extent.
She then placed them inside the book cupboard in
the class-room, and covered them with some sheets
of exercise paper.</p>
<p>The lesson proceeded even more painfully than
usual. Ardiune got hopelessly mixed between indefinite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
pronouns and indefinite pronominal adjectives,
and Fauvette floundered over the negations,
while Muriel found the proper placing of the <i>p</i>&#8217;s
and <i>l</i>&#8217;s in the conjugation of <i>appeler</i> an impossible
problem. As 12.30 drew near, there was much
glancing at wrist-watches. Mademoiselle kept her
eyes persistently turned away from the clock, with
the evident intention of once more ignoring the
time. This morning, however, Fate, in the person
of Raymonde, had been against her. Exactly at the
half-hour five alarums started punctually inside the
cupboard, raising such a din that it was impossible
to hear a word. Mademoiselle flew to investigate,
took them out, shook them, and laid them on their
backs, but they were wound up to their fullest extent,
and nothing short of a hammer would have
stopped them. The noise was terrific.</p>
<p>The baffled French governess, clapping her
hands over her ears, raised her eyebrows in a signal
of dismissal, and the girls availed themselves of the
permission with record speed. The alarums burred
cheerily on for about twenty minutes, after which,
by Mademoiselle&#8217;s instructions, they were replaced
in the monitresses&#8217; bedrooms by Hermie. The
Fifth were prepared for trouble, but to their surprise
no notice was taken of the incident at head-quarters.
Possibly Mademoiselle was aware that her late
efforts at discipline were regarded by Miss Beasley
with as little favour as her former slackness, and
considered it useless to appeal to her Principal.
She took the hint, however, and in future terminated
the lesson punctually at the half-hour, so
on this occasion the girls considered that they had
most decidedly scored.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A Mysterious Happening</h3>
</div>
<p>It was now nearly the end of July. The weather,
which for many weeks had been fine and warm,
suddenly changed to a spell of cold and wet. Rain
dripped dismally from the eaves, the tennis courts
were sodden, and the orchard was a marsh. The
girls had grown accustomed to spending almost all
their spare time out of doors, and chafed at their
enforced confinement to the house. They hung
about in disconsolate little groups, and grumbled.
Miss Beasley, who was generally well aware of the
mental atmosphere of the Grange, registered the
barometer at stormy, and decided that prompt
measures were necessary. To work off the steam
of the school, she suggested a good old-fashioned
game of hide-and-seek, and gave permission for it
to be played on those upper landings which were
generally forbidden ground. Twenty-six delighted
girls started at once upstairs, and passed through
the wire door, specially unlocked for their benefit,
to the dim and mysterious regions that lay under
the roof. It was the best place in the world for
the purpose&mdash;long labyrinths of passages leading
round into one another, endless attics, and innumerable
cupboards. The smallness of the latticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
windows, combined with the wetness of the
afternoon, produced a twilight that was most desirable,
and highly suited to the game.</p>
<p>Hermie and Veronica picked sides, and the
former&#8217;s band stole off to conceal themselves, while
the others covered their eyes in orthodox fashion,
and counted a hundred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cuckoo! We&#8217;re coming!&#8221; shouted Hermie at
last, and the fun began.</p>
<p>Up and down, and in and out, diving through
doorways, racing along passages, chasing one
another round corners, groping in cupboards,
panting, squealing, laughing or shuddering, the
girls pervaded the upper story. There was a
ghostly gloom about the old place which made
it all the more thrilling, and gave the players a
feeling that at any moment some bogy might spring
upon them from a dark recess, or a skinny hand be
stretched downwards through a trap-door. Flushed,
excited, and really a little nervous, both sides at
last sought the safety of the &#8220;den.&#8221; Two or three
of them began to compare notes. They were joined
by others. In a very short time the whole school
knew that at least a third of their number had seen
a &#8220;something.&#8221; They were quite unanimous in
their report. &#8220;It&#8221; was a girl of about their own
age, in a dark-green dress with a wide white
collar. Hermie and Ardiune had noticed her most
distinctly. She had smiled and beckoned to them,
and run along the passage, but when they turned
the corner she had disappeared; and Linda and
Elsie, whom they had met coming in the opposite
direction, declared that they had seen nobody. Lois
and Katherine had caught a glimpse of her as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
chased Maudie in one of the attics, and Joan declared
positively that she had seen her flitting down
the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s queer in the extreme,&#8221; murmured Valentine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you quite sure it wasn&#8217;t really only one of
us?&#8221; urged Meta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely!&#8221; declared Hermie emphatically.
&#8220;We all have on our brown serges to-day, and I
tell you this girl was in dark green; not a gym.
costume to wear over a blouse, like ours, but a
dress with long sleeves and a big white collar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s a real girl at all,&#8221; faltered
Magsie tremulously. &#8220;She&#8217;s a spook!&#8221;</p>
<p>Magsie voiced the opinion of the majority. It
was what most of the school had been feeling for
the last five minutes. The interest in the supernatural,
which had been a craze earlier in the term
until sternly repressed by Miss Beasley, suddenly
revived. Daphne remembered the magazine
article she had read entitled &#8220;The Borderland of
the Spirit World,&#8221; and cold thrills passed down
her spine. Veronica ventured the suggestion that
the apparition might be an astral body or an elemental
entity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a case for the Society for Psychical Research
to investigate,&#8221; she nodded gravely. &#8220;I always
said the Grange was bound to be haunted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was this girl like?&#8221; asked Raymonde
reflectively. &#8220;Ancient or modern?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Modern, decidedly. She had on a green dress
with a white&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve told us already,&#8221;&mdash;impatiently. &#8220;We
know about her clothes. What was she like?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>Hermie stood for a moment with eyes shut, as if
calling up a mental picture.</p>
<p>&#8220;About Ardiune&#8217;s height, but slimmer: rosy face,
and dark hair done in a plait&mdash;really not so unlike
you, Ray, only I should say decidedly prettier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; sniffed Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;That just about sizes her up!&#8221; agreed those who
had seen the vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t look spooky at all,&#8221; continued
Hermie. &#8220;She was quite substantial. You
couldn&#8217;t see through her, and she didn&#8217;t melt into
the air.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet she disappeared?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she certainly disappeared, and in a passage
where there were no doors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the story I told you of the
lady whose astral double left her body during sleep,
and haunted a friend&#8217;s house?&#8221; began Veronica
darkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell any ghost stories up here&mdash;don&#8217;t!&#8221;
implored Fauvette. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have hysterics in another
minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m frightened!&#8221; whimpered Joan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vote we go downstairs,&#8221; suggested Morvyth.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to play any more hide-and-seek at
present.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody else seemed anxious to pursue the game.
The attics were too charged with the occult to be
entirely pleasant. Everybody made a unanimous
stampede for the lower story, passing down the
winding staircase with a sense of relief. Once on
familiar ground again, things looked more cheery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back already?&#8221; commented Miss Gibbs, who
had met them on the landing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re all&mdash;er&mdash;a little tired!&#8221; evaded
Hermie, with one of her conscious blushes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better go to the dining-room and get out your
sewing, then,&#8221; replied the mistress, eyeing her
keenly.</p>
<p>The girls proceeded soberly downstairs, still keeping
close together like a flock of sheep. Raymonde,
however, lagged behind. For a moment or two
she stood pondering, then she ran swiftly up the
winding staircase again into the attic.</p>
<p>The talk of the school that evening turned solely
upon the ghost girl. Meta, who had not seen the
vision, declared it was nothing but over-excited
imagination, and feared that some people were apt
to get hysterical; at which Hermie retorted that no
one could be further from hysteria than herself,
and that six independent witnesses could scarcely
imagine the same thing at the same moment, without
some basis for their common report. Veronica
considered that they had entered unwittingly into
a psychic circle, and encountered either a thought-form
that had materialized, or a phantasm of the
living.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people have capacities for astral vision
that others don&#8217;t possess,&#8221; she said in a lowered
voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite probable that Hermie may be
clairvoyante.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hermie sighed interestedly. It was pleasanter
to be dubbed clairvoyante than hysterical. She
had always felt that Meta did not appreciate her.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve none of us been trained to realize our
spiritual possibilities,&#8221; she replied, her eyes wide
and thoughtful.</p>
<p>While a few girls disbelieved entirely in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
spectre, and others accepted the explanation according
to Veronica&#8217;s occult theories, most of the school
considered the attic to be haunted by a plain old-fashioned
ghost, such as anybody might expect to
find in an ancient mansion like the Grange. They
waived the subject of modern costume, deciding
that in the dim light such details could hardly have
been adequately distinguished, and that the apparition
must have been a cavalier or Jacobite
maiden, whose heart-rending story was buried in
the oblivion of years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps her lover was killed,&#8221; commented Fauvette,
with a quiver of sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or her father was impeached by Parliament,&#8221;
added Maudie.</p>
<p>&#8220;She may have had a cruel stepmother who ill-treated
her,&#8221; sighed Muriel softly.</p>
<p>Raymonde alone offered no suggestions, and
when asked for her opinion as to the explanation
of the mystery, shook her head sagely, and said
nothing. The immediate result of the experience
was that Veronica went to Miss Beasley, and borrowed
<i>An Antiquarian Survey of the County of
Bedworthshire, including a description of its Castles
and Moated Houses, together with a History of its
Ancient Families</i>&mdash;a ponderous volume dated 1823,
which had before been offered for the girls&#8217; inspection,
but which nobody had hitherto summoned
courage to attack. She studied it now with deep
attention, and gave a digest of its information for
the benefit of weaker minds, less able than her own,
to grapple with the stilted language. The school
preferred lighter literature for their own reading,
but were content to listen to legends of the past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
when told by Veronica, who had rather a gift for
narrative, and could carry her audience with her.
As the next afternoon was still hopelessly wet, the
girls gathered in one of the schoolrooms with their
sewing, and were regaled with a story while they
worked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found out all about the Grange,&#8221; began
Veronica. &#8220;It belonged to a family named Ferrers,
and they took the side of the King in the Civil
War. While Sir Hugh was away fighting in the
north, the house was besieged by Cromwell&#8217;s
troops. The Lady of the Manor, Dame Joan
Ferrers, had to look after the defence. She had
not many men, nor a great deal of ammunition,
and not nearly as much food as was necessary.
She at once put all the household upon short
rations, and drew up the drawbridge, barred the
great gates, and prepared to hold out as long as she
possibly could. She knew that the Cavalier forces
might be marching in the direction of Marlowe at
any time to relieve her, and that if she could keep
the enemy at bay even for a few weeks the Grange
might be saved. The utmost vigilance was used.
Sentries were posted in the tower over the great
gate, and the lady herself constantly patrolled the
walls. With so small a garrison it was a difficult
task, for the men had not adequate time to rest or
sleep, and were soon nearly worn out. The scanty
supply of food was almost at an end. Unless help
should arrive within a few days, they would be
obliged to capitulate. All the flour was gone, and
the bacon and salted beef, and the cocks and hens
and pigeons, and even the horses had been killed
and eaten, though these had been kept till the very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
last. The worst of the trouble was that there was
treachery within the walls. Dame Joan was well
aware of it, though she could not be absolutely
sure which of her men were disaffected, for they all
still pretended loyalty to their master and to the
King. Nobody, she felt, was really to be trusted,
though the walls were still manned, and the cannon
blazed away with what ammunition was left. If
the Grange were to be saved at all, it was imperative
that a message asking for help should be conveyed
to the Royalist forces. But how could it be
taken? The Roundheads were encamped all round
the walls, and would promptly shoot anyone who
attempted to penetrate their lines. None of the
garrison would be stout-hearted enough to venture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir Hugh&#8217;s eldest son was away fighting with
his father, but there was a daughter at home, a girl
of about thirteen, named Joyce. She came now to
her mother, and begged to be allowed to take the
message. It was a long time before Dame Joan
would give her consent, for she knew the terrible
danger to which Joyce would be exposed; but she
had the lives of her younger children to think of as
well, and in the end she gave her reluctant permission.
Just when it was growing dusk, she took
her little daughter to a secret doorway in the
panelling, from which a subterranean passage led
underneath the moat into the adjoining wood.
This secret passage was known only to Sir Hugh
and his wife and their eldest son, and it was now
shown to Joyce for the first time. It was a horrible
experience to go down it alone, but she was a brave
lassie, and ready to risk her life for the sake of her
mother, and her younger brothers and sisters. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
took a lantern to guide her, and set off with as
cheerful a face as she could show. The air was
stale and musty, and in some places she felt as if
she could scarcely breathe. Her footsteps, light
though they were, rang hollow. After what seemed
to her a very long way, she found herself in a small
cave, and could catch a gleam of twilight sky
through the entrance. She at once extinguished
the lantern, and advanced with extreme caution.
She was in the wood at the farther side of the moat,
a place where she had often played with her brothers,
and had gathered primroses and violets in the
springtime. She could recognize the group of tall
elms, and knew that if she kept to the right she
might creep through a hole in the hedge, and make
her way across some fields into the high road. As
quietly as some little dormouse or night animal she
stole along.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not far off she could see the great camp fire,
round which the troopers were preparing their
supper. She hoped they would all be too busy
with their cooking to notice her. As she passed
behind some bushes she suddenly caught the gleam
of a steel helmet within a few yards of her. She
crouched down under the shelter of a clump of
gorse. But in doing so she made a faint rustle.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Halt! Who goes there?&#8217; came the challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joyce&#8217;s heart was beating so loudly that she
thought it must surely be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sentry listened a moment, then levelling
his pistol, sent a shot through the gorse bush. It
passed within a few inches of her head, but she
had the presence of mind not to cry out or move.
Evidently thinking he was mistaken, the sentry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
paced farther on, and Joyce, seizing her golden
opportunity, slipped through the hole in the hedge.
Still using the cover of bushes, she made her way
across three fields, and reached the road. It was
quite dark now, but she knew her direction, and
turned up a by-lane where she would be unlikely
to meet troopers. All night she walked, guiding
herself partly by the stars, for she knew that
Charles&#8217;s Wain always pointed to the north. At
dawn a very tired and worn-out little maiden presented
herself at the gateway of Hepplethorpe
Manor, demanding instant audience of Sir Roger
Rivington. That worthy knight and loyal supporter
of the Crown, on hearing her story, immediately
sent horsemen with a letter to General
Bright, of the King&#8217;s forces, who lay encamped
only five miles off; and he, marching without
delay for Marlowe Grange, surprised the Parliamentarians
and completely routed them. The half-starved
garrison opened the great gates to their
deliverers with shouts of joy, and, we may be sure,
welcomed the supplies of food that poured into the
house later on. As for Joyce, she must have been
the heroine of the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; asked the girls, as Veronica paused
and began to count the stitches in the sock she was
knitting.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that&#8217;s in the book, and I&#8217;ve embroidered it
a little. It was told in such a very dull fashion, so
I put it in my own words. It&#8217;s quite true, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What became of Joyce afterwards?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She married Sir Reginald Loveday, and became
the lady of Clopgate Towers. The tomb is
in Byford Church.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;d been shot by the trooper, I should
have thought she was the ghost girl!&#8221; commented
Ardiune. &#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see how we could fix that
up, though. It doesn&#8217;t seem to fit. You&#8217;re quite
sure she escaped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly certain. How else could the Grange
have been saved?&#8221;</p>
<p>Veronica&#8217;s argument settled the question, but the
girls felt that the dramatic interest of the situation
would have been better suited if the story had ended
with the melancholy death of the heroine, and her
subsequent haunting of the Manor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always heard that Cromwell&#8217;s soldiers destroyed
the walls and made those big holes in the
gateway with their cannon-balls,&#8221; said Morvyth,
still only half convinced.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they did, but that was two years afterwards,
and the children were all sent safely away before
the second siege.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t solved the mystery of the ghost
girl,&#8221; persisted Ardiune. &#8220;Ray, what do you
think about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde, lost in a brown study, started almost
guiltily, and recommenced her sewing with feverish
haste.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think? Why, it&#8217;s a pretty story, of course.
What more can I think? Why d&#8217;you ask me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I don&#8217;t know, except that you generally
have ideas about everything. Who can the ghost
girl be?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Raymonde, having lost her scissors, was
biting her thread, and only shook her head in
reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>The Coon Concert</h3>
</div>
<p>At the end of the summer term it had always been
the custom of the school for each Form to get up
a separate little entertainment, at which the other
Forms should act audience. This year it was
unanimously decided not only to keep up the old
tradition, but to extend the original plan by charging
for admission, and sending the proceeds to the
Blinded Soldiers&#8217; Fund. This idea appealed greatly
to the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve given their eyes for us, and we ought
to do something for them!&#8221; declared Linda emphatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be awful to be blind,&#8221; sighed Muriel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and some of them are such lads, too!
Think of losing your sight, and having your whole
career ruined, when you&#8217;re only nineteen or twenty,
and the ghastly prospect of living years and years
and years till you&#8217;re quite old, and never being
able to see the sun again, and the flowers, and your
friends&#8217; faces, or anything that makes life beautiful!
I don&#8217;t think half of us realize what our soldiers
have suffered for us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re so patient and cheerful!&#8221; added
Veronica. &#8220;In my opinion they prove their heroism
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
as much by the way they bear their ruined
lives afterwards as by their deeds in the trenches.
It has shown what stuff British folk are made of.
And you get such surprises. Often a boy whom
you&#8217;ve known, and always thought weak and selfish
and silly, will turn out to have any amount of grit
in him. There&#8217;s one in particular&mdash;a friend of ours.
He cared for nothing before except amusing himself&mdash;the
kind of boy who&#8217;s always getting into
debt and doing foolish things. Well, he&#8217;s utterly
changed; he&#8217;s not like the same fellow. I think
the war will have made a great difference to many
of our men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to our women too, I hope,&#8221; said Miss
Beasley, who, unnoticed by Veronica, had joined
the group. &#8220;It would be a poor thing for the
country if only the men came purified out of this
time of trouble. &#8216;A nation rises no higher than its
women!&#8217; And now is Woman&#8217;s great opportunity.
I think she is taking it. She is showing by her
work in hospitals, in canteens, on the land, in
offices, or in public service, how she can put her
shoulder to the wheel and help in her country&#8217;s
hour of need. I believe this war will have broken
down many foolish old traditions and customs, and
that people will be ready afterwards to live more
simple, natural lives than they did before. The
school-girls of to-day are the women of to-morrow,
and it is on you that the nation will rely in years
to come. Don&#8217;t ever forget that! Try to prove
it practically!&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Beasley seldom &#8220;preached&#8221; to the girls,
but when she spoke, her few quiet words generally
had their effect. Hermie and Linda in especial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
turned them over in their minds. As the result of
their mistress&#8217;s last remark, they made a suggestion
to their fellow-monitresses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of us are leaving this term, and at any
rate in a few years we shall all have left, and be
scattered about in various places. Wouldn&#8217;t it be
nice to make a kind of League, and undertake that
every girl who has belonged to this school will do
her very best to help the world? It should be a
&#8216;Marlowe Grange&#8217; pledge, and we&#8217;d bind ourselves
to keep it. If a whole school makes up its mind to
a thing, it ought to have some effect, and it would
be splendid to feel that our school had been an
inspiration, and helped to build up a new and
better nation after the war. There are only twenty-six
of us here at present, but suppose when we
leave we each influence ten people, that makes two
hundred and sixty, and if they each influence ten
people more, it makes two thousand six hundred,
so the thing grows like circles in a pond. I don&#8217;t
mean that we&#8217;re to be a set of prigs, and go about
criticizing everybody and telling them they are
slackers&mdash;that&#8217;s not the right way at all; but if we
stick up constantly for all that we know is best,
people will probably begin to sympathize, and
want to do the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hermie&#8217;s and Linda&#8217;s idea appealed to the Sixth.
They instituted the League at once, and persuaded
the entire school to join. They put their heads
together, and drew up a short code which they
considered should explain the attitude of their
society. It ran as follows:&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<table summary='rules'>
<tr><td style='text-align:center'>MARLOWE GRANGE LEAGUE</td></tr>
<tr><td style='text-align:center'>AFTER-THE-WAR RULES</td></tr>

<li>To do some definite, sensible work, and not to
spend all my time in golf, dances, and other
amusements.</li>

<li>To read wholesome books, study Nature, and be
content with simple pleasures.</li>

<li>Not to judge my friends by the standards of

</ol></td></tr></table>

<p style='text-align:center;font-variant:small-caps; margin-top:0;'>God Save the King</p>
<p>In order to make the League a binding and lasting
affair, the monitresses decided to give each
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
member a copy of the code, and ask her to sign her
name to it. For this purpose they made twenty-six
dainty little books of exercise paper, with covers
of cardboard (begged from the drawing cupboard)
decorated with Japanese stencils of iris, chrysanthemums,
birds and reeds, or other artistic designs,
the backs being tied with bows of baby ribbon.
After the list of rules, were appended a few suitable
quotations, and blank pages were left, so that each
individual could fill them up with extracts that she
liked, either cut out of magazines or written in her
own hand. Most of the girls admired Robert Louis
Stevenson, so the selections began with his wise and
tender epitome of life:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest, to be kind, to earn a little and to
spend a little less, to make upon the whole a family
happier for his presence, to renounce when that
shall be necessary and not be embittered, to keep
a few friends, but these without capitulation. Above
all, on the same grim condition, to keep friends
with himself. Here is a task for all that a man has
of fortitude and delicacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Linda and Hermie could not agree whether
this ideal of life or the one by William Henry
Channing was the more beautifully expressed, it
was agreed to put the latter&#8217;s as well:&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;To live content with small means; to seek elegance
rather than luxury, and refinement rather than
fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy,
not rich, to study hard, think quietly, talk gently,
act frankly; to listen to stars and birds, to babes
and sages with open heart; to bear all cheerfully,
do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never; in a
word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
grow up through the common&mdash;this is to be my
symphony.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the League was to be nothing if not practical,
everyone felt that the best way of upholding its
principles at the present moment was to raise a
good collection for the fund for the blinded soldiers.
The Sixth determined to give a theatrical performance,
the juniors a display of gymnastics and
dancing, and the Fifth concentrated their minds
upon a concert.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not to be just an ordinary concert,&#8221; said
Ardiune, addressing a select committee of management;
&#8220;it must be something extra special and
outside, such as we&#8217;ve never had before in the
school, so rub up your ideas, please, and make
suggestions. I&#8217;m waiting!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather a big order to get anything entirely
new!&#8221; grunted Morvyth. &#8220;I should say everything
on the face of the earth&#8217;s been tried already!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not here! How you catch me up!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t time to get up an operetta, I suppose?&#8221;
ventured Fauvette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly&mdash;in three days!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A patriotic performance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Had one only last term, so it would come
stale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what can we have?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know!&#8221; exclaimed Raymonde, bouncing up
from her chair, and taking a seat upon the table
instead. &#8220;I vote we be coons!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s coons?&#8221; asked Katherine ungrammatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you stupid! You know! You sing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
plantation songs, and wear a red-and-white costume,
and wave tambourines, and that sort of
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we black our faces?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can if we like, but it isn&#8217;t necessary.
We&#8217;re not to be nigger minstrels exactly. Coons
are different. Of course, the songs are all about
Sambos and Dinahs, but white people can sing
them with quite as great effect. I believe the
Bumble&#8217;s got some castanets and things put away
that we could borrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So she has! Bags me the cymbals!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pity nobody can play the banjo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, we shall do very well with the
piano.&#8221;</p>
<p>The committee having decided that their concert
was to be a coon performance, the girls set to work
accordingly to make preparations. All the songbooks
in the school were ransacked to find plantation
melodies, and after much discussion, not
to say quarrelling, a programme was at length
arranged, sufficiently spicy to entertain the girl
portion of the audience, but select enough not to
offend the easily shocked susceptibilities of Miss
Gibbs, whose ideas of songs suitable for young
ladies ran&mdash;in direct opposition to most of her
theories&mdash;on absolutely Early Victorian lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gibbie&#8217;s notion of a concert is &#8216;Home, Sweet
Home&#8217; and &#8216;Cherry Ripe&#8217;, and perhaps &#8216;Caller
Herrin&#8217; if you want something lively,&#8221; pouted
Ardiune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and even those have to be edited,&#8221; agreed
Morvyth. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember when we were
learning &#8216;Cherry Ripe&#8217;, she insisted on our changing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
&#8216;Where my Julia&#8217;s lips do smile&#8217; into &#8216;Where
the sunbeams sweetly smile?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she wouldn&#8217;t let us sing &#8216;The Blue Bells
of Scotland&#8217;, and we knew it was just because it
began: &#8216;Oh where, tell me where, is your Highland
laddie gone?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know it&#8217;s highly improper for a school-girl
even to mention a laddie?&#8221; murmured Katherine
ironically.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the blinded soldiers, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another matter, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here&mdash;let&#8217;s take our programme to the
Bumble, and get her to pass it beforehand, and then
there can be no criticisms afterwards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got another idea,&#8221; propounded Raymonde.
&#8220;Suppose, instead of having our concert in the
lecture hall, we ask the Bumble to let us have it in
the barn instead? It would be just twice as coony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Top-hole! It would be a regular stunt!&#8221; agreed
the committee.</p>
<p>A deputation waited upon Miss Beasley, and
found her quite gracious and amenable to reason,
both in respect of the choice of plantation ditties
and the use of the barn as a place of entertainment.
She even vouchsafed the further and most valuable
suggestion that they might supply refreshments
and charge for them, to help to swell the funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can send an order to the Stores at Gladford
to-morrow for cakes and biscuits. Cook shall make
you some lemonade, and you may have the oil stove
in the barn and supply cocoa at twopence a cup.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May we sell sweets, Miss Beasley?&#8221; asked Raymonde
tentatively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes. I don&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t.
You may put down chocolates with your order for
cakes and biscuits, if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The delegates made a cheerful exit from the study,
and hurried to communicate their good tidings to
the rest of the Form.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Jubilate! We&#8217;ll make a night of it!&#8221; commented
Katherine. &#8220;The Bumble&#8217;s turned into
an absolute honey-bee!&#8221;</p>
<p>Great were the preparations for the event.
Costumes had to be contrived&mdash;a difficult matter
with only the school theatrical box to draw upon&mdash;and
ten coons to be turned out in uniform garb.
The usual stock properties, such as the brigand&#8217;s
velvet jacket, the Admiral&#8217;s cocked hat, or the hunting
top-boots, were utterly useless, and the girls had
to set their wits to work. They decided to wear
their best white petticoats with white blouses, and
to make hats out of stiff brown paper trimmed with
rosettes of scarlet crinkled paper (obtainable at the
village shop), using bands of the same scarlet for
belts and ties.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course we&#8217;d rather have had real rush-hats
and ribbons, but if you can&#8217;t get them you can&#8217;t, and
there&#8217;s an end of it, and you must just make up
your mind to do without!&#8221; said Raymonde philosophically.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I sing too hard I know I&#8217;ll burst my waistband!&#8221;
objected Morvyth, who always looked on
the gloomy side of events.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t sing too hard, and don&#8217;t take any
refreshments, if you&#8217;ve such an easily expanding
figure!&#8221; snapped Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could stitch the crinkled paper over an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
ordinary belt, and then it wouldn&#8217;t break through,&#8221;
suggested Valentine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarlet&#8217;s not my colour!&#8221; mourned Fauvette.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Baby, you look nice in anything!&#8221;
returned Aveline soothingly. &#8220;And your white
petticoat&#8217;s a perfect dream! I always said it was
a shame to wear it under a dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entertainment was to take place in the evening,
after preparation, and on the afternoon of the
day in question the Fifth Form took sole and
absolute possession of the barn, turning everybody
else out, even those indignant enthusiasts who were
at work at the wood-carving bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mind, our tools haven&#8217;t got to be touched, or
we&#8217;ll have something to say!&#8221; called out Daphne
as she made an unwilling exit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall put them all in the box!&#8221; returned
Morvyth, slamming the door.</p>
<p>The wood-carving bench had to serve as refreshment
table, so it was cleared with scant ceremony,
in spite of Daphne&#8217;s protest; a clean cloth, borrowed
from the cook, was spread upon it, and plates of
cakes and biscuits, and packets of chocolates, were
laid out as attractively as possible, with vases of
flowers between.</p>
<p>Raymonde, who was nothing if not inventive,
suddenly evolved a new and enterprising scheme.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must have a platform!&#8221; she decided.
&#8220;Come along to the wood pile, and we&#8217;ll get some
packing-cases and put railway sleepers over them.
It won&#8217;t take us long!&#8221;</p>
<p>It turned out a more strenuous business than
she had anticipated, however, for it was difficult
in the first place to find packing-cases of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
same height, and more difficult still to get the railway
sleepers to fit neatly together on the top of
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;ll hold up!&#8221; said Aveline dubiously,
when the erection was at last complete.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;ll just have to hold!&#8221; returned Raymonde
in her airiest manner. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s nicer than a
stiff platform, and more suitable for a barn. It
looks really &#8216;coony&#8217;, and suggests the Wild West,
and log-cabins, and all that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately after preparation, the coons retired
to make final arrangements in the barn. The big
stable lanterns were lighted and hung up for purposes
of illumination, and a cauldron of water was
set upon the oil cooking-stove. It was a horrible
scramble, for time was short, and they still had to
change their dresses. Everyone seemed in everybody
else&#8217;s way, and each gave directions to the
others, though nobody was in authority, and all got
decidedly cross and snapped at one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an atom of use sticking up that lantern
unless you fill it first,&#8221; urged Valentine. &#8220;I tell
you it&#8217;s almost empty, and won&#8217;t burn twenty
minutes. You don&#8217;t want to perform in the dark,
I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ought to have been filled before!&#8221; grumbled
Ardiune. &#8220;Here, give me the paraffin can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care what you&#8217;re doing! You&#8217;re slopping
into the cauldron!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I saw you! We shall have to empty out
the cauldron and wash it and refill it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; interfered Raymonde. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t time. Val, is that lantern finished? Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
hang it up, and come along and dress. We shall
have everybody arriving before we&#8217;re half ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost every amateur concert begins late, and
this was no exception to the rule. By the time the
coons had scrambled into their costumes, and Fauvette
had got her best lace-trimmed white petticoat
fastened adequately on to her blouse with safety-pins,
and Katherine had adjusted her tie to her
satisfaction, and Muriel had induced her paper hat
to tilt at the right angle on her head, the audience
was clamouring for admission at the door of the
barn, and making moral remarks on the subject of
punctuality.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re awfully sorry,&#8221; panted Raymonde in
excuse, undoing the padlock which the coons had
left fastened, and allowing the school to tramp
into the place of entertainment. &#8220;Your shillings,
please! Yes, we&#8217;re taking the money first thing,
instead of handing round the plate in the interval.
Where&#8217;s the Bumble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just coming now, with Gibbie and Ma&#8217;m&#8217;selle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The barn with its dark rafters, stable lanterns,
and improvised benches, certainly looked a most
appropriate setting for a plantation programme,
and Miss Beasley glanced round with amused interest
on her arrival. She and the other mistresses
were escorted to special posts of honour, and the
performance began without further delay. Everybody
admired the costumes; the red-and-white
effect was quite charming, especially when worn
by all ten alike, and the paper hats with their big
rosettes gave a coquettish appearance that added
to the piquancy of the songs. There could, of
course, be no piano accompaniment, but the girls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
made up for it by a liberal clashing of cymbals,
rattling of castanets, and jingling of tambourines.
They were as &#8220;cute&#8221; and &#8220;coony&#8221; as they knew
how to be, putting a great deal of action into the
songs, and adding a few comic asides. At Raymonde&#8217;s
suggestion, they had decided during the
performance of &#8220;The Darkies&#8217; Frolic&#8221; to dance a
lively kind of combined fox-trot and cake-walk
measure to illustrate the words. They had practised
it carefully beforehand, and considered it the
<i>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</i> of the evening. But alas! they
had not calculated on the difference between the
firm floor of the barn and the extremely shaky
erection on which they were perched. They were
only half-way through, and were capering in most
approved darky fashion, when the middle packing-case
which supported the planks suddenly gave
way, and the platform collapsed. Some of the girls
sprang off in time, but several went down among
the ruins, and were rescued by the agitated mistresses,
fortunately without real injuries, though
there were scratches and bruises, and at least half
a yard of lace was torn from Fauvette&#8217;s best petticoat.</p>
<p>As &#8220;The Darkies&#8217; Frolic&#8221; was the last item but
one in the first half of the programme, and the
performers were naturally ruffled by their unexpected
accident, Miss Beasley suggested that they
had better have the interval at once, and soothe
their feelings with cakes and cocoa before resuming
the entertainment. The little spread on the wood-carving
bench looked attractive; the Stores had
sent a tempting selection of cakes, and the audience
was quite ready for refreshment. Ardiune, presiding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
at the cauldron, mixed cups of cocoa as
speedily as possible, and handed them out in exchange
for twopences. At the first sip, however,
an expression of acute disgust spread itself over
the countenance of each consumer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; choked Hermie. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter
with the stuff? It&#8217;s simply atrocious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It tastes of paraffin!&#8221; proclaimed Veronica,
pulling a wry face.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! I told you so!&#8221; whispered Valentine to
Ardiune. &#8220;You have just gone and done it this
time!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no doubt about the matter. The contents
of the cauldron were quite undrinkable, and
the girls had to fall back on the small quantity of
lemonade which the cook had provided. It was a
most mortifying experience, especially happening
just after the failure of the platform. The Sixth
were looking amused and superior, the juniors were
grumbling, and Miss Beasley was saying &#8220;Never
mind, so long as we help the blinded soldiers;&#8221;
which was kind, but not altogether comforting.
The audience made up for the lack of cocoa by
their consumption of confectionery, and went on
buying till not a solitary cake or packet of chocolate
was left upon the bench.</p>
<p>The second half of the programme had to be
performed upon the floor, but went off nevertheless
in quite good style and with much flourish of instruments.
Fauvette, with her torn lace hurriedly
pinned up, piped a pretty little solo about &#8220;piccaninnies&#8221;
and &#8220;ole mammies&#8221;; Aveline and Katherine
gave a spirited duet, and the troupe in general
roared choruses with great vigour. Everybody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
decided that the evening&mdash;barring the cocoa&mdash;had
been a great success. The proceeds, in particular,
were highly satisfactory.</p>
<p>&#8220;One pound ten shillings!&#8221; announced Raymonde.
&#8220;Just count it over, somebody, please,
to make sure I&#8217;m right! I don&#8217;t call that half bad
for a Form concert. If the others do as well, we
shall have quite a nice sum. Shall I give it to the
Bumble now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone upstairs. Besides, I believe it&#8217;s
Gibbie who&#8217;s going to send off the money. You&#8217;d
better keep it till the others have had their entertainments,
and it can all be handed in together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o! I&#8217;ll take it and lock it up in my
drawer. I say, it was awful fun being coons,
wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Top-hole!&#8221; agreed the others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>The Blinded Soldiers&#8217; Fund</h3>
</div>
<p>The examinations were drawing most horribly and
imminently near, and the Fifth Form, feeling themselves
for the most part ill prepared for the ordeal,
were shivering in anticipation. Armed with textbooks,
they made desperate efforts to pull up
arrears, and stock their brains with an assortment
of necessary facts. Ardiune crammed dates at every
available moment, Morvyth studied the map of
Europe, Valentine devoted herself to Virgil, and
Magsie wept over French verbs, while the rest tried
to fill up any educational gaps and holes where
they knew they were lacking. The image of the
Rev. T. W. Beasley, M.A. loomed large on the
horizon, and his advent was hardly regarded with
pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;ll be scared to death!&#8221; moaned Aveline.
&#8220;If there are any viva voces I shall break
down altogether. I know I shall! Directly he
looks at me and asks a question, every single idea
will go bang out of my head!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how well you know things if
you&#8217;re nervous!&#8221; agreed Katherine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate the written exams!&#8221; groaned Raymonde.
&#8220;They&#8217;re so long, and one gets so inky, and one&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
hand grows so stiff. I never can express myself
well on paper. Gibbie says I&#8217;ve no gift for composition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There aren&#8217;t any J pens left in the cupboard,&#8221;
volunteered Maudie. &#8220;And Ma&#8217;m&#8217;selle says it&#8217;s
not worth while sending for more just at the end
of the term, and we must use Waverleys for the
exam. There&#8217;s a whole boxful of those.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a shame! I can&#8217;t write with a
Waverley!&#8221; protested Raymonde in much indignation.
&#8220;It&#8217;ll spoil my whole exam. I call that
tyranny! Look here! I&#8217;m not going to be done!
I shall send for a fountain pen with a broad nib.
I saw one advertised in a magazine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bumble won&#8217;t let you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t ask her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how&#8217;ll you get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, trust me! I&#8217;ll manage it somehow. I&#8217;m
not generally easily circumvented when I set my
mind upon anything. I&#8217;ve a plan already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you? What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that would be telling!&#8221; laughed Raymonde.
&#8220;Perhaps my pen will come floating in
through the window!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mad creature! I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ll
really get it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait and see!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Fifth Form possessed a little upstairs room
at the Grange which they called their sanctum. It
held a piano, and was mainly used for practising,
but the girls sometimes studied there out of preparation
hours. Its principal article of furniture
was a large, old-fashioned bureau, which Miss
Beasley had bought among other things when she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
took over the house. She had given every girl in
the Form one of its drawers, together with a key, so
that each could have a place in which to keep any
special treasures locked up.</p>
<p>As Raymonde sat in the sanctum that afternoon
alone, trying to apply her mind to memorizing
certain axioms of Euclid, Veronica came bustling
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;You here, Ray? Miss Beasley wants some
change to pay the laundry. You&#8217;ve got the money
you collected at your coon concert last night; can
you let her have thirty shillings in silver, and she&#8217;ll
give you notes instead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; replied Raymonde, rising at once
and unlocking her drawer in the bureau. &#8220;Here
you are&mdash;four half-crowns make ten shillings, eight
shillings is eighteen, and twenty-four sixpences
make thirty shillings altogether. I&#8217;d just as soon
have notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221; said Veronica. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring them up
to you later on, or send somebody with them. I
hope our entertainment will do as well as yours.
By the by, a queer thing happened just this minute.
I saw the ghost girl again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Raymonde excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peeping round the corner of the winding staircase;
but she vanished instantly. I went up a few
steps, but couldn&#8217;t see her. The wire door was
open, and I very nearly ran up to the attic to
investigate, but I knew Miss Beasley was waiting
for the change. I must rush and give it to her
now, or there&#8217;ll be squalls. Ta-ta!&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde did not either lock up her drawer or
resume her Euclid. She stood for a moment or two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
pondering. Then a mischievous light broke over
her face, and she clapped her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Splendiferous! I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221; she said aloud;
and, whisking out of the room, she ran up the winding
staircase, and through the open wire door into
the forbidden but fascinating territory of the attics.</p>
<p>The girls at the Grange were obliged to keep
strictly to their practising time-table, and Raymonde
was due at the piano in the sanctum from
5.30 until 6.15. At 5.40, which was fully ten
minutes late, the strains of her Beethoven Sonata
began to resound down the passage. Mademoiselle,
passing from her bedroom, stood for a moment to
listen. She was impressed by the fact that Raymonde
was playing much better than usual, and
performing in quite a stylish fashion the passage
which usually baffled her. She almost opened the
door to congratulate her pupil, but being in a hurry
changed her mind, and ran downstairs instead. A
little later Veronica, also in much haste, entered
the room arm-in-arm with Hermie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Beasley has sent the notes, Ray,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t stop. I&#8217;ll just pop them
inside your drawer, and you can put them away
properly when you&#8217;ve finished practising.&#8221;</p>
<p>The figure at the piano did not turn her head, or
attempt to reply, but went on diligently with the
scherzo movement of the Sonata, bringing out her
chords crisply, and executing some quite brilliant
runs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymonde&#8217;s improving enormously in her
music,&#8221; commented Hermie, as the two monitresses
went back along the passage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Veronica. &#8220;And how remarkably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
pretty she looked to-night! Her hair was
quite curly, and she had such a lovely colour. Did
you notice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That room&#8217;s so dark, I can&#8217;t say I did, particularly.
Ray&#8217;s not bad looking, though I don&#8217;t call
her exactly a beauty!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looked a beauty this evening! Fauvette
will have to mind her laurels! She&#8217;s always been
the belle of the Form until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Maudie Heywood, in accordance with the
practising time-table, came at 6.15 to claim the
piano, she found the sanctum unoccupied. Raymonde&#8217;s
drawer in the bureau was shut and locked.
This fact Maudie noticed almost automatically.
At the moment it seemed a matter of no consequence,
though in the light of after events it was to
assume a greater importance than she could have
imagined.</p>
<p>Raymonde turned up late for preparation, looking
hot and conscious, and with her brown serge
dress only half fastened. She gave no excuse for
her lack of punctuality, and took her loss of order
mark with stoicism.</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you doing?&#8221; whispered Aveline,
when the evening work was over and the books
were being put away.</p>
<p>Raymonde&#8217;s head was inside her desk. She
drew it out, and seemed on the point of uttering
a confidence. Then, suddenly changing her mind,
she stooped again to arrange her papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little girls shouldn&#8217;t ask questions!&#8221; she
grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well!&#8221; flared Aveline, who was very
easily offended. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you needn&#8217;t tell me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
anything if you don&#8217;t want to, thanks! I shan&#8217;t
force your silly secrets from you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly won&#8217;t!&#8221; snapped Raymonde, as
Aveline flounced away.</p>
<p>There was no time for further bickering. The
juniors were giving their gymnastic and dancing
display in the lecture hall, and Miss Beasley had
announced that she wished the entertainment to
begin promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a shot at us!&#8221; sniggered Ardiune. &#8220;I
know the Coons started late, but we really couldn&#8217;t
help it. It took me ages to help Fauvette into her
costume, not to speak of getting into my own as
well. The Fourth are only performing in their gym.
dresses, so it&#8217;s easy enough for them to be punctual.
I&#8217;ll stump up my shilling cheerfully for the sake of
the blind Tommies, but I don&#8217;t expect much of a
show for my money&#8217;s worth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more do I,&#8221; agreed Katherine. &#8220;I&#8217;m fed
up with Swedish drill. I confess my interest
centres in the refreshments.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, the Fifth were agreeably surprised at
the achievements of the performers. The juniors
had been practising in private under the instruction
of Miss Ward, the visiting athletics mistress,
and had quite a novel little programme to present
to their schoolfellows. They exhibited some remarkably
neat skipping drill, and also some
charming Russian and Polish peasant dances, and
a variety of military exercises that would almost
have justified their existence as a Ladies&#8217; Volunteer
Corps. It was a patriotic evening, with much
waving of flags and allusions to King and Country.
Even the refreshments were in keeping, for the table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
was decorated with red, white and blue streamers,
and there were on sale little packets of chocolates
wrapped up in representations of the Union Jack.
The cocoa on this occasion was immaculate, and
everything was served with the utmost daintiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a decent business for the kids!&#8221; commented
Ardiune, &#8220;but not half the fun of our coon
performance!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was ripping in the barn!&#8221; agreed Morvyth.</p>
<p>There remained one more entertainment in aid of
the Blinded Soldiers&#8217; Fund, that of the Sixth Form,
which was expected by everybody to be the best.
Miss Beasley had thrown it open to outsiders, and
some of the ladies who attended the geology lectures
had promised to come and bring friends. In view
of this augmented audience the performers made
extra-special efforts. They held frequent rehearsals
with closed doors, and took elaborate pains to prevent
impertinent juniors from obtaining the least
information as to their plans. The wildest notions
circulated round the school. It was rumoured that
a musical comedy was to be presented, the male
parts being taken by professional actors specially
engaged from London for the occasion; then that,
failing the professionals, Miss Beasley and Miss
Gibbs had consented to play the two heroes, and
might be expected to appear in tights, with flowered
waistcoats and cocked hats. In the imagination of
the gossipmongers Professor Marshall, as a Greek
tragedian, and Mr. Browne, garbed as a highwayman,
were to be added to the list of artists. It was
even whispered that the Reverend T. W. Beasley,
M.A., who was booked to arrive on Monday, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
consented to come earlier, for the purpose of joining
in the festivities, and would appear in the character
of a humorist, and give some wonderful exhibitions
of lightning changes of costume and ventriloquism.
The uncertainty as to what might be expected
certainly enhanced the pleasure of anticipation.
Not a girl would have missed this performance for
worlds.</p>
<p>The Sixth kept their secret well. Not a word
leaked out as to the true nature of the programme.
Meta, indeed, went about with rather mincing steps,
while Veronica seemed to affect a truculent attitude;
but whether this was the result of learning
parts, or was put on with deliberate intention to
deceive, the wide-awake members of the Fifth could
not determine.</p>
<p>The entertainment was to be held on Saturday,
when, as there was no preparation, the whole evening
could be devoted to amusement. It was announced
to begin at 6 p.m., with box office open at
5.45. The school turned up with prompt punctuality,
and would have scrambled for the door, if
Barbara, seated at the receipt of custom, had not
insisted upon their forming an orderly and orthodox
queue. She took their shillings in a business-like
manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Programmes&mdash;hand painted&mdash;sixpence each.
Please buy one for the good of the cause!&#8221; she
added.</p>
<p>The programmes, produced in Linda&#8217;s and
Hermie&#8217;s best style, were attractive. Each had a
different picture upon its cover, and all were tied
up with white satin ribbon. The girls opened them
eagerly, and read:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>

</table>
<p>&#8220;So the Bumble and Gibbie aren&#8217;t in it, after
all!&#8221; whispered Aveline. &#8220;I never thought they
would be, nor the Professor, nor Mr. Browne either,
and certainly not Mr. Beasley! It promises to be
decent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope they&#8217;ll begin promptly!&#8221; murmured Morvyth.
&#8220;I say, Barbara, isn&#8217;t it time you began to
dress?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t come on till the second scene,&#8221; explained
Barbara, &#8220;so I can change while they&#8217;re
acting the first. That&#8217;s why they put me as doorkeeper.
Go back to your seats. Visitors are
arriving.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two front rows had been reserved for outsiders,
and presently began to be filled by those
who had bought tickets. Miss Beasley and Miss
Gibbs took their places, Mademoiselle played an
introductory fantasia upon the piano, and the
curtains were drawn aside.</p>
<p>There was no doubt about the play being amusing;
from first to last the audience was convulsed. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
actresses threw themselves admirably into their
parts, and rendered their characters with the utmost
spirit. Veronica, well padded with pillows, made
a stout and presentable Sir Anthony Absolute, and
played the autocratic parent to the life. Hermie,
with blue cloak, sword, and military stride, endeavoured
to live up to her conception of an eighteenth-century
buck, and made love with a fervour
that was all the more enhanced by the sight of Miss
Gibbs in the front row, sitting with pursed-up lips
and straightened back. Meta, as Lydia Languish,
sighed, wept, made eyes, and indulged in a perfect
orgy of sentiment, while Lois acted the cheeky
maidservant with enthusiasm. The best of all,
however, was Mrs. Malaprop; Linda had seen the
play on the real stage, and reproduced a famous
actress to the utmost of her ability. Her absurd
manners and amusing mistakes sent the room into
a roar, and she occasionally had to wait for quiet
until she could continue her speeches.</p>
<p>Everybody voted the evening a huge success.
The visitors heartily congratulated Miss Beasley
upon the cleverness of her elder pupils, and hoped
they would sometimes give another open performance.
The girls clapped till their hands were
sore. Even Miss Gibbs, though she considered
that the love-making had exceeded the limit allowable
in school theatricals, expressed guarded approval.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve cleared two pounds three and sixpence!&#8221;
announced Barbara gleefully to the Fifth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; exclaimed Valentine. &#8220;And we made
one pound ten, and the kids one pound seven.
What does it tot up to?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Five pounds and sixpence,&#8221; calculated Barbara
after a moment&#8217;s scribbling on the back of a programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I call it a very decent result for a school
of only twenty-six girls!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>An Accusation</h3>
</div>
<p>On the following Monday afternoon the Reverend
T. W. Beasley arrived in readiness to begin, on
Tuesday morning, his task of examining the school.
There was great fluttering in the dove-cot, and
much anxiety on the part of the girls to catch the
first glimpse of him. They had decided that, as
the brother of their good-looking Principal, he
would be tall, fair, and clean-shaven, with classical
features, gentle blue eyes, and a soft, persuasive
manner&mdash;the ideal clergyman, in fact, of the storybook,
who lives in a picturesque country rectory
and cultivates roses. To their disappointment he
was nothing of the sort, but turned out to be a
short, broad-set little man, with a grey beard and
moustache, and keen dark eyes under bushy eyebrows,
and a prominent nose that was the very
reverse of romantic. He cleared his throat frequently
in a nervous fashion, and when he spoke
he snapped out his remarks abruptly, in a very
deep voice that seemed to rise almost out of his
boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t half as nice as Professor Marshall!&#8221;
decided the Fifth unanimously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as if he had a temper!&#8221; ventured Fauvette.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s cruelty to give us viva voces! I&#8217;ll
never dare to answer a question!&#8221; wailed Aveline.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll be strict,&#8221; admitted Katherine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;s nervous too, and scared of us!&#8221;
suggested Morvyth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it!&#8221; laughed Raymonde
scornfully. &#8220;I flatter myself I&#8217;m pretty good at
reading faces, and I can see at a glance he&#8217;s a
martinet. That frown gives him away, and the
kind of glare he has in his eyes. I&#8217;m a believer
in first impressions, and I knew in a second I
wasn&#8217;t going to like him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aveline sighed dramatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rough on a poor young girl in her early
teens to be put through an ordeal by a stern and
elderly individual who&#8217;ll have absolutely no consideration
for her feelings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Feelings! You&#8217;ll have your head snapped
off!&#8221; prophesied Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t the Bumble have examined us
herself, or at any rate let the Professor do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask me a harder, child!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I think it&#8217;s very unnecessary to have this
Mr. Beasley. Bumble Bee, indeed! He&#8217;s a regular
hornet!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whatever the private opinion of the Fifth might
be on the subject of their examiner, they were
obliged to hide their injured feelings under a cloak
of absolute propriety. The reverend visitor was a
solid fact, and all the grumbling in the world could
not remove the incubus of his presence. At nine
o&#8217;clock on Tuesday morning he would begin his
inquisition, and the girls judged that there would
be scant mercy for any sinner who failed to reach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the required standard. A terrible atmosphere of
gloomy convention pervaded the school. Miss
Beasley was anxious for her pupils to appear at
their very best before her scholarly brother, whose
ideal of maidenly propriety was almost medi&aelig;val,
and she kept a keen eye on their behaviour. Nobody
dared to speak at meal-times, except a whispered
request for such necessary articles as salt and
butter; laughter was out of the question, and even
a smile was felt to be inappropriate. The girls
sat subdued and demure, outwardly the pink of
propriety, but inwardly smouldering, and listened
obediently while the visitor, mindful of his educational
position in the establishment, held forth upon
subjects calculated to improve their minds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe Gibbie likes him either!&#8221; opined
Katherine, after Monday night&#8217;s supper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not! He beats her on her own
ground. As for the Bumble, she&#8217;s quite distraught.
She keeps glancing at us as if she expected somebody
all the time to spill her tea, or break a plate,
or pull a face, or do something dreadful. We&#8217;re
not usually an ill-behaved set!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting on my nerves!&#8221; complained
Aveline.</p>
<p>&#8220;The place is more like a reformatory than a
school!&#8221; growled Morvyth.</p>
<p>When the post-bag arrived on Tuesday morning,
it contained, among other letters and parcels, a
small narrow packet directed to Miss R. Armitage.
Miss Gibbs, whose business it was to overlook her
pupils&#8217; correspondence, was in a particular hurry,
as it happened, and inclined for once to scamp her
duties.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this, Raymonde?&#8221; she asked perfunctorily.
&#8220;A fountain pen, did you say? For the
exams. I suppose your mother has sent it. There
are two letters for Aveline and one for Morvyth.
You may take them to them, and tell Daphne I
want to speak to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde did not stop for further interrogation.
She beat as speedy a retreat as possible, delivered
the message and the letters, and finished unpacking
her parcel. Her Form mates, more inquisitive
than Miss Gibbs, gathered round her and began
to catechize.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you got there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did it come by the post?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a fountain pen, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who sent it to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you buy it, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks a jolly nice one!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it full, or empty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk all at once, children!&#8221; commanded
Raymonde loftily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll answer your questions in
proper order, so just behave yourselves!</p>
<p>&#8220;1. It is a fountain pen, as anybody with half an
eye could see!</p>
<p>&#8220;2. It came by the post.</p>
<p>&#8220;3. Nobody sent it to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;4. I bought it.</p>
<p>&#8220;5. It is a jolly nice one.</p>
<p>&#8220;6. I have reason to believe it is empty. I&#8217;m
going to fill it out of Fauvette&#8217;s bottle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheek!&#8221; returned Fauvette, allowing her friend
to help herself to the Swan ink, however. &#8220;What
puzzles me, is how you managed to buy it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your little head, Baby, is easily puzzled,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
smiled Raymonde serenely. &#8220;It&#8217;s meant to wear
fluffy curls, and not to engage itself in abstruse
problems. I don&#8217;t advise you to worry yourself
over this, unless you can turn it to some account.
If the Hornet should ask you for an original example,
you might begin: &#8216;Let A represent a fountain
pen, and B my schoolmate, C standing for an
unknown quantity&#8211;&#8211;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Fauvette, at this point, placed her hand over her
chum&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; she begged beseechingly. &#8220;If I get
any of those wretched A B and C questions I&#8217;ll
collapse, and disgrace the Form. I&#8217;ve many weak
points, but mathematics are absolutely my weakest
of all. If you frighten me any more, I shan&#8217;t have
the courage to walk into the exam. room. Do I
look presentable? Are my hands clean? And is
my hair decent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look so much more than presentable that
anybody but a hardened brute of an examiner would
be bowled over by you utterly and entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he hasn&#8217;t any feelings, so it&#8217;s no use
trying to work upon them,&#8221; said Fauvette plaintively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joking apart, Ray, where did you get that
fountain pen?&#8221; asked Morvyth.</p>
<p>Raymonde&#8217;s eyes twinkled.</p>
<table style='margin: auto' summary=''><tr><td>
<p style='margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0;'>
&#8220;Little flower, could I tell you that,<br />
I&#8217;d tell you my heart&#8217;s secret with it!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>she misquoted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But do tell me! I think you might!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The more you tease, the less you&#8217;ll find out!&#8221;</p>
<p>The school bell put an end to the conversation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
and the girls, with straightened faces, marched to
their places in the big lecture hall. The Reverend
T. W. Beasley had taken full command of the
examinations, and had introduced several innovations.
On former occasions each Form had sat
and written in its own room, but now desks had
been placed for the whole school together, and
were so arranged that the Forms sat alternately,
a junior being sandwiched between each senior.
The girls were hugely insulted. &#8220;He suspects
we&#8217;ll copy each other&#8217;s papers!&#8221; thought Raymonde,
and flashed her indignation along to Aveline. She
did not speak, but her expressive glance drew forth
a reproof from the examiner. He cleared his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any girl communicating either by speech or
otherwise will be dismissed from the room!&#8221; he
announced freezingly.</p>
<p>After that, the girls scarcely dared to look up
from their papers. They studied their questions
and wrote away, some fast and furiously, and
others with the desponding leisure of those having
very little to put down. Mr. Beasley sat upon the
platform, toying with his watch-chain, and keeping
his eye upon the movements of the candidates.
Fauvette, finishing long before the others, ventured
to raise her eyes as high as his boots, and let them
rest there, marvelling at the size and thickness of
the footgear, and congratulating herself that she
could wear number three.</p>
<p>The morning wore itself slowly away. When
the school compared notes at 12.30, the girls agreed
that they had never in their lives before been given
such an atrocious and detestable set of examination
papers. The Sixth had fared as badly as the Fifth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
or the juniors, and even monitresses were loud in
their complaints. Certain viva voces taken in the
afternoon confirmed their ill opinion of their
examiner.</p>
<p>&#8220;He glares at one till one&#8217;s frightened out of
one&#8217;s wits!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he hurries so&mdash;one hasn&#8217;t time to answer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he takes things in quite a different way
from what Gibbie does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s no need to be sarcastic!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sarcastic, did you say? I call him downright
rude!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He evidently doesn&#8217;t think much of our intellects!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t think much of him, anyway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he uses pomatum on his hair,&#8221; confided
Fauvette in a shocked whisper.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear, I believe it&#8217;s bear&#8217;s grease!&#8221; corrected
Morvyth scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the most painful week I&#8217;ve ever had to
go through in all my life,&#8221; bleated Aveline. &#8220;Even
if I live through it&mdash;and that&#8217;s doubtful&mdash;I shall be
a nervous wreck. They&#8217;ll have to send me for a
rest cure during the holidays. I&#8217;m not accustomed
to be cross-questioned as if I were a criminal in the
dock!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a witness, child, you mean,&#8221; amended Raymonde.
&#8220;Criminals don&#8217;t generally give evidence
against themselves. But we understand you, all
the same! For two pins I&#8217;d sham utter ignorance,
and give him some very surprising answers. Yes,
I would, if Gibbie or the Bumble didn&#8217;t stick in the
room the whole time! That&#8217;s the worst of it. They&#8217;d
know in a second that I was only having him on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>As the week progressed, the school considered
itself more and more ill-used. The fact was that
the Reverend T. W. Beasley was accustomed to
university students, and could not focus his mind
to the intellectual range of girls of thirteen to seventeen.
Moreover, he was by nature a reformer. He
liked to give others the benefit of his advice, and
he had much to say in private to his sister upon
the subject of her pupils&#8217; lessons and general
management. Perhaps poor Miss Beasley had not
expected quite so much criticism. She was accustomed,
nevertheless, to defer to her brother&#8217;s
opinions, and she listened with due humility,
though with much inward perturbation, while he
laid down the law upon the education of women.
Miss Gibbs, who was a born fighter, was inclined to
argue&mdash;a disastrous policy, which so nearly ended
in what are generally termed &#8220;words,&#8221; that her
Principal was obliged to ask her (privately) to allow
the visitor to state his views uninterrupted.</p>
<p>The school was so taken up with the stern business
on hand, that such delights as coon concerts
and theatricals were quite in the background. On
Thursday afternoon, however, Veronica sought out
Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want your money for the Blinded Soldiers&#8217;
Fund,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve given in ours, and so have
the juniors. Miss Beasley says when she has it all
she&#8217;ll write a cheque for the amount, and send it to
the secretary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Miss Beasley has our money already,&#8221;
objected Raymonde. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember? She
said she wanted some change, and you came and
asked me for it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So I did, and brought you back notes instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense, Ray! You know I brought
them,&#8221; protested Veronica indignantly. &#8220;You
were practising, and I said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t stop, I&#8217;ll put
them inside your drawer.&#8217; Hermie was with me at
the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A conscious look spread over Raymonde&#8217;s face.
She blushed hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it last Friday?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it was Friday. The notes must be
in your drawer. Have you the key? Then come
along, and we&#8217;ll go and find them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde unwillingly followed Veronica upstairs.
Her manner was embarrassed in the extreme.
She unlocked her drawer in the bureau,
and turned out the possessions she had there, but
no notes were among them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become of them?&#8221; demanded Veronica
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I really don&#8217;t know!&#8221; faltered Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you must find out. As treasurer for your
Form, you are responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure you put them in my drawer, and not
in anybody else&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain. It was the bottom one on the right-hand
side, and it was open just as you left it when
you gave me the silver. I couldn&#8217;t be mistaken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde flung herself down on a chair, and
buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to think,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>Veronica gazed at her with growing suspicion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s my duty to report this to
Miss Beasley,&#8221; she remarked freezingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, please!&#8221; pleaded Raymonde, starting
up in great agitation. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you give me just
a few days, and then&mdash;well perhaps it will be all
right. Leave it over till Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be all wrong!&#8221; said the monitress sternly.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand you, Raymonde, for either
you have the money or you haven&#8217;t. If you have,
you must hand it over; and if you haven&#8217;t, we&#8217;ve
got to find out where it&#8217;s gone. That&#8217;s flat! So
come along with me at once to the study.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Principal, on being told the facts of the case,
was astonished and distressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There may possibly be some misunderstanding,&#8221;
she urged. &#8220;Before anybody is accused we
will make sure that the notes were not placed in a
wrong drawer. Tell every member of the Fifth to
come at once to the practising-room, and bring her
keys. You will go upstairs with me, Raymonde.&#8221;</p>
<p>Veronica&#8217;s message spread consternation through
the Form. The girls trooped to the sanctum with
scared faces. They found Miss Beasley there,
looking very grave, and Raymonde, her eyes
downcast and her mouth set in its most obstinate
mould, standing by the bureau.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you each to unlock your drawer in my
presence,&#8221; said the Principal. &#8220;The money collected
at your concert is missing, and perhaps it
may have been misplaced.&#8221;</p>
<p>In dead silence the girls complied, every one in
turn showing her possessions. There were certainly
no notes among them. Miss Beasley turned
to Veronica.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What time was it when you took up the
money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About five minutes to six, Miss Beasley. It
was just before I went into preparation. Hermie
was with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you leave the drawer open or shut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shut it, but did not lock it. Raymonde&#8217;s keys
were dangling in it. I thought she would lock it
for herself when she had finished practising.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who came into the room next? Maudie Heywood?
Then, Maudie, did you notice the keys
hanging in the drawer when you arrived at 6.15?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Miss Beasley, they were certainly not
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, girls, you may go now. Veronica,
tell Hermie to go to my study and wait for me.
Raymonde, you will stay here. I wish to speak to
you alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Principal waited until the door had closed
on her other pupils, then turned to the white-faced
little figure near the bureau.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymonde, this is a sad business,&#8221; she said
solemnly. &#8220;You had better confess at once that
you have taken this money.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>A Mystery Unravelled</h3>
</div>
<p>Raymonde started, and faced the Principal with
flaming eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t! I didn&#8217;t!&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will explain,&#8221; continued Miss
Beasley, watching her searchingly, &#8220;how it is that
you were seen at Marlowe post office on Friday
afternoon, and that you bought a postal order for
twelve and sixpence. Oh, Raymonde, you may
well blush! Mrs. West was calling only an hour
ago, and told me that she had seen you in the shop.
She asked if I knew about it, or if you had been
there without leave. Why did you get a postal
order?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde was silent for a moment. Then:</p>
<p>&#8220;To send for a fountain pen,&#8221; she stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You admit that you visited the post office?
Now, I know that you had finished all your pocket-money.
You drew the last of your allowance from
me on the day of your concert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a pound-note of my own, put away in my
handkerchief case. My uncle gave it to me last
holidays.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If that is so, then where is the money for which
you were treasurer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymonde, I can&#8217;t believe such a story. You&#8217;re
not telling me the truth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed, indeed I am!&#8221; burst out Raymonde.
&#8220;Oh! what shall I do? I can&#8217;t explain, and I can&#8217;t
say any more. If you&#8217;d only wait a few days!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I shall not wait,&#8221; returned the headmistress
coldly. &#8220;The matter must be investigated
at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Beasley, greatly upset by such a happening
in her school, consulted her brother as to her best
course to pursue. On learning the circumstances
he took a very grave view of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s little doubt of the girl&#8217;s guilt,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;She evidently yielded to a sudden temptation.
She wanted a fountain pen in time for the
examinations, and she borrowed the notes which
had been left in her charge, in order to send for it.
Probably she wrote home for more money, and
expected to be able to replace it, and that is the
explanation of her asking for a few days&#8217; grace. It
seems to me as clear as daylight, and I should deal
with her as she deserves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask one question?&#8221; said Miss Gibbs, who
also had been called to the conclave. &#8220;How is it
that Mrs. West affirms that she saw Raymonde in the
post office at six o&#8217;clock on Friday, while Veronica
and Hermie declare that at five minutes to six she
was sitting at the piano in the practising-room? It
is not possible to reach the village in five minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Beasley started. This aspect of the matter
had not occurred to her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very perplexing!&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymonde has been troublesome,&#8221; continued
Miss Gibbs, &#8220;but I have always found her scrupulously
straight and truthful. Such a lapse as this
seems to me utterly foreign to her character.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never know what a girl will do till she&#8217;s
tried!&#8221; commented the Rev. T. W. Beasley.
&#8220;Better expel her at once, as a warning to the
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give her a chance!&#8221; pleaded Miss Gibbs.
&#8220;The evidence is really so unsatisfactory. Wait a
day or two, and see if we can sift it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I knew what is best!&#8221; vacillated the
Principal. &#8220;It is so near the end of the term that
it seems a pity to send Raymonde home till next
week, when she would be going in any case. I
will call at the post office, and make enquiries as to
the exact time she came there last Friday. I think
I won&#8217;t decide anything before Saturday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Beasley stuck to this determination, in spite
of her brother&#8217;s protests against over-leniency and
lack of discipline. She excused herself on the
ground that she did not wish to disturb the examinations,
which were to continue until Friday evening.
Meanwhile Raymonde was in the position
of a remanded prisoner at the bar. She was not
allowed to mingle with the rest of the school. She
was conducted, under Mademoiselle&#8217;s escort, to her
place in the examination hall, but spent the remainder
of her time in the practising-room, which
served as a temporary jail. Her meals were sent
up to her, and no girl was allowed, under penalty
of expulsion, to attempt to communicate with her.
She was not permitted to go to the dormitory at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
night, but slept on a chair-bed in Miss Beasley&#8217;s
dressing-room.</p>
<p>Naturally the episode was the talk of the school.
Its interest eclipsed even the horror of the examinations.
It seemed a mystery which no one could
disentangle. The girls remembered only too well
that Raymonde had been very secretive about how
she had obtained the fountain pen; but, on the other
hand, witnesses declared that they had seen her
both at the post office and in the practising-room,
when she certainly could not have been in two
places at once.</p>
<p>The Fifth decided that the Reverend T. W.
Beasley must be at the bottom of it. There had
never been any disturbances before he came to the
school, and since his arrival everything had been
unpleasant, therefore he must be distinctly responsible
for Raymonde&#8217;s misfortunes; which was
hardly a reasonable conclusion, however loyal it
might be to their friend. The Mystics talked the
matter over in private, and suggested many bold
but quite impracticable schemes, such as subscribing
the missing money amongst them, or throwing
up a rope-ladder to the sanctum window for Raymonde
to escape by, neither of which plans would
have cleared her character.</p>
<p>Raymonde herself preserved an extraordinary
attitude of obstinacy. She utterly refused to give
any more explanations. She did not cry, but there
was a grey misery in her face that was worse than
tears. She walked in and out of the examination
hall with her head proudly erect. Her comrades,
with surreptitious sympathy, glanced up as she
passed, but under the lynx eye of their examiner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
were unable to convey to her the notes which
several of them at least had prepared ready to pass
under the desk.</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon Raymonde was sitting alone
in the practising-room, when the door was unlocked
and Veronica entered with a tray.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to bring your tea,&#8221; explained the
monitress. &#8220;I don&#8217;t really know whether I&#8217;m supposed
to be allowed to talk to you, but Miss Beasley
didn&#8217;t tell me not to, so I shall. Look here, Ray,
why don&#8217;t you end this wretched business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish I could!&#8221; groaned Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can. There&#8217;s something behind it all,
I&#8217;m sure. Take my advice, and explain it to Miss
Beasley. She&#8217;d be quite decent about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde shook her head sadly and silently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she would, if you&#8217;d only confess. I can&#8217;t
understand you, Ray. You were always a madcap,
but you never did anything underhand or sneaky
before; even when you were naughtiest you were
quite square and above-board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221; smiled Raymonde faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think why you should have changed,
and conceal everything! Ray, I appeal to your
best side. You signed our Marlowe Grange League,
and seemed quite enthusiastic about it at the time.
Won&#8217;t you try to live up to it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde rose to her feet. In her eyes were
two smouldering fires.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t understand!&#8221; Her voice was trembling
with passion. &#8220;It&#8217;s exactly because I signed
that paper and promised to be faithful to my
friends and to speak the truth, that I&#8217;m in all this
trouble. No, I tell you I won&#8217;t explain! If you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
think so badly of me that you won&#8217;t believe my
word, it&#8217;s no use my speaking to you. Oh! I hate
everybody, and I hate everything! I wish I could
go home!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better stay and clear things up!&#8221; said Veronica.
&#8220;If I could do anything for you, I would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; asked Raymonde with a flash
of hope. &#8220;Could you possibly get a letter posted
for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Veronica shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I daren&#8217;t!&#8221; she said briefly. &#8220;Miss Beasley
trusted me to bring up your tea, and I mustn&#8217;t
forget I&#8217;m a monitress. I shall have to tell her
that I&#8217;ve been speaking to you. I ought to go
now. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde drank her tea, but left the bread and
butter untouched. She was not hungry, and her
head ached. The whole of her gay, careless world
seemed to have crumbled to ashes. She wondered
what her chums were thinking of her. Did they,
like Veronica, mistrust her conduct? She knew
that her behaviour was extraordinary. A sense of
utter desolation swept over her, and, pushing aside
the tea things, she leaned her arms on the table,
with her hot face pressed against them.</p>
<p>From this despairing attitude she was aroused by
Miss Gibbs, who five minutes later came to fetch
the tray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give way, Raymonde!&#8221; said the mistress,
laying quite a kindly hand on the girl&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;There&#8217;s to be proper enquiry into this matter
to-morrow, and I, for one, trust you&#8217;ll be able to
clear yourself. Keep your self-control, and be prepared
to answer any questions that are put to you
then. Remember there&#8217;s nothing like courage and
speaking the truth.&#8221;</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>Raymonde raised herself slowly, hesitated for a
moment, then fumbled in her pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Gibbs,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;I&#8217;d love to tell you
everything, but I can&#8217;t. I wonder if you&#8217;d trust me
enough to send off this letter without opening it, or
asking me what I&#8217;ve written in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mistress took the envelope and examined it.
It was addressed to Miss V. Chalmers, Haversedge
Manor, near Byfield. She looked into Raymonde&#8217;s
eyes as if she would read her very soul. Her pupil
bore the scrutiny without flinching.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a most unwarrantable thing to ask, but
I will do it,&#8221; replied Miss Gibbs. &#8220;I hope my
confidence in you will be justified.&#8221;</p>
<p>At 9.30 on the following morning a trap arrived
at the Grange to convey the Reverend T. W.
Beasley and his Gladstone bag to the railway
station. A row of heads peeping from behind the
curtains in the upper windows watched him depart,
and exhibited manifestations of intense satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! He&#8217;s actually gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only hope he won&#8217;t miss his train and come
back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! He&#8217;s in heaps of time, thank goodness!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad he isn&#8217;t staying the week-end!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got to preach somewhere in aid of something
on Sunday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May he never come here again, that&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps in secret Miss Beasley was equally relieved.
She had passed a strenuous week, and had
possibly arrived at the conclusion that she was, on
the whole, capable of arranging her own school to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
the satisfaction of herself and the parents of her
pupils. She considered that she understood girls
better than a bachelor university don, however
great his literary attainments, could do. The experiment
had not been altogether a success, and
need not be repeated. She sighed as she waved
a last good-bye and turned into the house.</p>
<p>An urgent matter, which she had put off until her
brother&#8217;s departure, must now claim her attention.
She ordered the entire Fifth Form, together with
Hermie and Veronica, to repair to the practising-room,
where Raymonde was still kept prisoner.</p>
<p>The girls marched in as quietly as if they were
going to church. Their Principal sat by the table,
with two little parallel lines of worry on her usually
smooth forehead, and a grieved look in her grey
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very distressing to me to be obliged to
make this enquiry,&#8221; she began, &#8220;but it is absolutely
necessary that we find out what has become of those
missing notes. I put you all on your honour to
tell me what you know. Can any girl throw any
light on the matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked anxiously and wistfully round the
little circle, but nobody replied. Raymonde sat with
downcast eyes, and the old obstinate expression
on her face. The eyes of all the other girls were
focused upon her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am most loath to accuse anyone of such a
dreadful thing as taking money,&#8221; continued Miss
Beasley, &#8220;but unless you can offer me some explanation,
Raymonde, I shall be obliged to send
you home. The facts look very black against you.
You were treasurer, and cannot produce the funds;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
you were seen buying a postal order, and you
received a handsome fountain pen by post.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, Miss Beasley,&#8221; interposed
Veronica, &#8220;how could Raymonde be buying a
postal order when Hermie and I saw her practising
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is most puzzling, I allow; but both Mrs.
Sims the postmistress, and Mrs. West, who happened
to be buying groceries in the shop, agree
emphatically that it was Raymonde who came to
the counter. They say that she was not in school
uniform, but wore a green dress and a small cap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymonde has no green dress!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she has admitted to me that she bought
the postal order.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls looked at their chum in consternation.
Raymonde buried her face in her hands.</p>
<p>At this critical juncture there was the sound of
a scrimmage outside in the passage, and a loud
excited voice was heard proclaiming:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go in! I tell you I&#8217;ve come to see Miss
Raymonde Armitage, and it&#8217;s important. Miss
Beasley there? All the better! I want to speak to
her too. Will you kindly move out and let me
pass? Oh, very well then&mdash;there!&#8221;</p>
<p>The door opened with a forcible jerk, and a
stranger entered unceremoniously. She was a
damsel of perhaps fifteen, slim, and very pretty,
with twinkling brown eyes and curly hair and coral
cheeks. She wore an artistic dress of myrtle-green
Liberty serge, with a picturesque muslin collar, and
had a chain of Venetian beads round her white
throat.</p>
<p>The school gazed at her spellbound, almost aghast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The ghost-girl!&#8221; murmured Veronica faintly
sinking into a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violet!&#8221; exclaimed Raymonde in tones of
ecstasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, here I am, right enough!&#8221; announced the
stranger. &#8220;Cycled over directly I read your letter.
Stars and stripes! You&#8217;ve got yourself into a jolly
old mess! Hope they haven&#8217;t tortured you yet!
I suppose they still use the rack and the thumbscrew
in this benighted country? Cheero! We&#8217;ll
pull you through somehow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, catching the Principal&#8217;s amazed and outraged
expression, she continued: &#8220;Sorry! Are
you Miss Beasley? I ought to have introduced
myself. I do apologize! My name&#8217;s Violet
Chalmers, and I&#8217;m an American.&#8221;</p>
<p>She proclaimed the fact proudly, though her soft
r in &#8220;American,&#8221; and slightly nasal intonation,
would have established her nationality anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask your errand?&#8221; said the head mistress
rather stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. I&#8217;ve come to help Raymonde out
of a scrape. I never dreamed she&#8217;d be landed in
such a queer business as this. I say, Ray, will
you explain, or shall I do the talking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, please!&#8221; entreated Raymonde.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, as I&#8217;ve just said, I&#8217;m an American. We
crossed the herring-pond just before the war started,
and we&#8217;ve been stuck in this old country ever since.
Before you all came to the Grange we rented the
place for a year, and a time we had of it, too, with
rats and bats, and burst pipes, and no central heating
or electric light! Mother went almost crazy!
Well, last Easter, when I was staying at the seaside,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
I met Raymonde, and we chummed no end.
She told me that her school was moving in here,
and I bet her a big box of Broad Street pop-corns
I&#8217;d turn up some time in the house and astonish the
girls. I only bargained that she wasn&#8217;t to let any
of them know beforehand of my existence. Well,
I guess I kept my word. I joined in a game of
hide-and-seek one dark afternoon, and I reckon I
passed off as a first-class ghost. Didn&#8217;t I chuckle,
just! You wonder how I got in without anybody
seeing me? Why, I&#8217;d discovered the secret passage
that leads, from a sliding panel in the attic, right
under the moat into a cave inside the wood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joyce Ferrers&#8217; passage!&#8221; exclaimed the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very same. I rode over on my bicycle&mdash;we&#8217;re
staying only eight miles away&mdash;left it inside
the cave, lighted my lamp, and strolled up to the
attic as easily as you please. There was the whole
school tearing around like mad, so I scuttled round
too, and scared you just some! It was so prime,
I guessed I&#8217;d try it on again. That was yesterday
week. I&#8217;d luck enough to catch Raymonde, and
she was a sport that day too. We changed clothes,
and I came downstairs here and did her practising
for her, while she explored the secret passage and
did a little shopping on her own account in the
village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was you, and not Raymonde, whom
we saw sitting at the piano!&#8221; exclaimed Veronica.</p>
<p>Violet nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly so! I guessed I was going to be found
out, and daren&#8217;t turn my head when you spoke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see the notes put into the drawer?&#8221;
enquired Miss Beasley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I saw them afterwards, lying just on
the top of some other papers. I locked the drawer
before I left the room, and put the bunch of keys
inside the pocket of Raymonde&#8217;s dress, which I had
on. I meant to tell her about it, but I forgot. She
was in such a hurry when she came back, and said
she&#8217;d be late for prep., so we each scrambled into
our own clothes, and she tore off downstairs, and
I went home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This, unfortunately, does not bring us any
nearer to the solution of the puzzle&mdash;what has
become of the notes?&#8221; said Miss Beasley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymonde couldn&#8217;t have spent them in the
village, when she had gone out before they were put
there!&#8221; ventured Veronica.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I certainly didn&#8217;t abscond with them!&#8221;
declared Violet. &#8220;Though I really believe Ray
thinks so. Confess you do, old sport!&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymonde blushed crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d taken them for a joke,&#8221; she
said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that why you refused to explain?&#8221; interposed
the Principal quickly. &#8220;You were afraid of getting
your friend into trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Miss Beasley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s become of the wretched notes?&#8221;
asked Violet; &#8220;They must be somewhere. Have
you looked properly through this old bureau? I
know these queer shallow drawers by experience,
and things sometimes slip over the backs of them.
Have you had the drawer right out? It&#8217;s stuck,
has it? Oh, it probably only wants a good pull!
Lend me your key! Here goes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Violet exerted all her strength in a mighty tug,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
and the drawer tumbled out with a jerk. She put
in her hand and felt about in the space behind.
There was a large hole in the back of the bureau,
and her fingers went through it into a cavity in the
wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something queer here!&#8221; she exclaimed,
drawing out a round ball of shreds of paper.
&#8220;Mrs. Mouse&#8217;s nursery, if I don&#8217;t mistake! Sorry
to intrude, but we&#8217;ll take a peep at the children!&#8221;</p>
<p>Very gingerly she pulled aside the torn pieces of
paper, and disclosed to view four little atoms not
much bigger than bluebottles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby mice!&#8221; squealed the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame to disturb them, but I&#8217;ve got to examine
their cradle. Ah! what d&#8217;you make of this, now?
If it isn&#8217;t a piece of a ten-shilling note, I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll
swallow the babies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are most undoubtedly right!&#8221; declared
Miss Beasley, picking up the shreds of paper and
trying to piece them together. &#8220;The mouse must
have taken them out of the drawer to help to build
her nest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather an expensive nursery!&#8221; chuckled
Violet. &#8220;Well, I guess we&#8217;ve proved who&#8217;s the
thief, anyway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am extremely obliged to you,&#8221; said Miss
Beasley. &#8220;But for you, the matter might always
have remained a mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And please forgive me for interfering. It was
cheek, I know, to turn up in the attic, but I couldn&#8217;t
resist the secret passage. I think this old place
must be ripping as a school. I want to come next
term. We&#8217;d intended to go home to New York in
September, but Dad heard this morning he&#8217;d have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
to stay here another couple of years on business, so
he said he guessed I&#8217;d best settle down and learn to
be a Britisher. Would you have me here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That depends on whether your father wishes to
send you to me or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Dad&#8217;ll let me do anything I like, so it&#8217;s
as good as settled. I&#8217;ll arrive with my boxes in
September. Look here, it&#8217;s cheek again, but will
you please not scold Raymonde for all this affair?
It was mostly my fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Raymonde had no business to change places
with you, and go to the village without leave,&#8221; said
Miss Beasley, eyeing her pupil reprovingly. &#8220;But
I think she has been punished enough. She may
take you downstairs now, and ask Cook to give you
some cake and a glass of milk before you cycle
home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks ever so! I came without my breakfast.
I&#8217;m real hungry now. I&#8217;ll talk Dad over, and get
him to write to you about my coming to school
here. I&#8217;m dead nuts on it. Good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; murmured Veronica to Hermie, as
Violet, with a final squeeze of the Principal&#8217;s hand,
made her smiling exit; &#8220;well, all I can say is that
if this American girl comes next September there&#8217;ll
be lively doings! Raymonde&#8217;s bad enough&mdash;but
to have two madcaps in the school! I&#8217;m thankful
I&#8217;m leaving!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I pity the monitresses!&#8221; agreed Hermie.</p>
